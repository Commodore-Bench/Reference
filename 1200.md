# $1200-$12FF - BASIC General-Purpose Working Storage

## 4608-4609 $1200-$1201 OLDLIN <a name="1200"></a>
### Line number where program stopped
Whenever a BASIC program stops because of an END or
STOP statement, or because the end of the program has been
reached, or because the RUN/STOP key has been pressed,
then the STOP/END routine [$4BCB](4000#4BCB) will be executed. That
routine stores the line number where the program stopped in
this pair of locations (in low-byte/high-byte format). The
CONT routine [$5A60](4000#5A60) uses the value here to determine where
to restart the program. These locations are also used for temporary
storage during the RENUMBER routine [$5AF8](4000#5AF8).

## 4610-4611 $1202-$1203 OLDTXT <a name="1202"></a>
### Pointer to the start of current line
Each time a BASIC program line is executed, the address of
the first character of program text in the line is stored in these
locations. The high byte ($1203) is also used as a flag to
indicate whether the program can continue after being halted.
The CONT routine [$5A60](4000#5A60) will give a CAN'T CONTINUE error
message if the flag byte is 0/$00. The flag location is initialized to
0/$00 during the CLR routine [$51F8](4000#51F8)-you can't
CONTinue a program before it is run. If the program halts without errors,
the flag location will hold the high byte of the address of the line
where the program stopped, which will always
be nonzero, so the program can be CONTinued. However, if
the program stopped because of an error, or if any lines are
changed after the program has stopped, then the flag location
will be reset to zero and the program cannot be CONTinued.

## 4612-4615 $1204-$1207 PUCHRS <a name="1204"></a>
### Character definitions for PRINT USING
The values in these locations determine which characters will
be used for the redefinable characters in the PRINT USING
format. The default values are copied from locations $5250-
$5253 in BASIC ROM during the CLR routine, so the default
definitions will be restored each time a program is run. In
BASIC, the definitions here can be changed using the PUDEF
statement.

**$1204**: This location holds the filler character for the pattern,
the one which will be used to fill unused positions in the
format. The default value is 32/$20, the space character.

**$1205**: This location holds the comma character for the
pattern. The character with the code specified here will be
substituted wherever a comma appears in the PRINT USING
format. The default value is 44/$2C, the comma character.

**$1206**: This location holds the decimal point character for
the pattern. The character with the code specified here will be
substituted wherever a decimal point (period) appears in the
PRINT USING format. The default value is 46/$2E, the period
( . ) character.

**$1207**: This location holds the monetary symbol character for the
pattern. The character with the code specified here
will be substituted wherever a dollar sign ($) appears in the
PRINT USING format. The default value is 36/$24, the dollar
sign character.

## 4616 $1208 ERRNUM <a name="1208"></a>
### Number of most recent error
Whenever a BASIC error occurs, the ERROR routine [$4D3C](4000#4D3C)
stores the error number here. The reserved variable ER always
reflects the value in this location. Refer to the entry for the error
message table [$484B](4000#484B) for a complete list of
error numbers. Once an error number is stored here, the value
is retained until another error occurs or until the location is
reinitialized. This location is initialized to 255/$FF during CLR
[$51F8](4000#51F8) (also executed as part of NEW and RUN). This setting
results in a value of -1 in the reserved variable ER, so when
ER contains that value no error has yet occurred.

## 4617-4618 $ 1209-$120A ERRLIN <a name="1209"></a>
### Line number where most recent error occurred
Whenever a BASIC error occurs, the ERROR routine [$4D3C](4000#4D3C)
checks the run mode flag (127/$7F) to see if the error occurred
in a program line or an immediate mode line. If the error was
in a program line, the current line number is copied
here from locations 59-60/$3B-$3C. The reserved variable EL
always reflects the value in these locations. Once a line number
is stored here, it will be retained until another error occurs
or until the locations are reinitialized. These locations are
initialized to 65535/$FFFF during CLR [$51F8](4000#51F8) (also executed as
part of NEW and RUN). Thus, when the reserved variable EL
contains 65535 no error has yet occurred.

## 4619-4620 $120B-$120C TRAPNO <a name="120B"></a>
### Target line number for TRAP statement
When error trapping is enabled with the TRAP statement, the
target line number to which the program will be directed
when an error occurs is stored here (in standard lowbyte/high-byte order).
Location 4620/$120C is also used as a
flag to determine whether trapping is enabled. The flag location is
initialized to 255/$FF during CLR (which is also part of
NEW and RUN). Since the high bytes of all valid line numbers are less
than 255/$FF, trapping is considered disabled as
long as the flag location contains that value. When trapping is
enabled, the ERROR routine [$4D3C](4000#4D3C) will transfer control to
the line number indicated here whenever a BASIC error occurs.

## 4621 $120D TMPTRP <a name="120D"></a>
### Temporary storage for high byte of TRAP line number
When an error is trapped to a specified line, the ERROR routine
[$4D3C](4000#4D3C) copies the high byte of the target line number
from 4620/$120C into this location, then stores the value
255/$FF in 4620/$120C. This disables the trapping of errors
during the error-handling routine, which would otherwise put
the program into an infinite loop. The value here is copied
back into 4620/$120C during execution of the RESUME statement
[$5F62](4000#5F62).


## 4622-4623 $120E-$120F ERRTXT <a name="120E"></a>
### Pointer to start of statement where last error occurred
Whenever an error occurs, the ERROR routine [$4D3C](4000#4D3C) copies
the value in 4610-4611/$1202-$1203 into these locations.
The HELP subroutine that highlights the portion of the line
where the error occurred uses the value here to determine
where to begin the highlighting. The RESUME routine [$5F62](4000#5F62)
uses the value here to determine where to resume execution.

## 4624-4625 $1210-$1211 TEXT_TOP <a name="1210"></a>
### End-of-program pointer
These locations contain the address of the location immediately
following the end of BASIC program text. The NEW
statement [$51D6] initializes the value here to two bytes beyond
the address in the start-of-program pointer (45-46/
$2D-$2E). The value here is updated to reflect the new ending
address whenever a line is added or deleted from the program.
An OUT OF MEMORY error occurs if the value here ever exceeds
the value in [$1212-$1213](#1212). Following a
LOAD or DLOAD, these locations are set to one byte beyond
the last location to which data was loaded. For a SAVE or
DSAVE, the value here determines the last address from
which data will be saved.

## 4626-4627 $1212-$1213 MAX_MEM_O <a name="1212"></a>
### Top-of-BASIC pointer
The value in this pair of locations determines the top of free
memory in block 0 RAM. The address will be one location beyond
the highest one available for BASIC program text. An
OUT OF MEMORY error will occur when the value in locations
[$1210-$1211](#1210) exceeds the value here. The
BASIC cold-start initialization subroutine [$4045](4000#4045) writes the
value 65280/$FF00 here, so that all block 0 RAM below the
MMU registers is available for program text. You can reserve
an area at the top of program memory by reducing the value
in these locations. Unlike some of the other pointers, you need
only store the new value here; no subsequent NEW or CLR is
required.

## 4628-4629 $1214-$1215 TMPTXT <a name="1214"></a>
### Temporary text pointer storage for DO
This pair of locations is used to temporarily hold the CHRGET
text pointer value (from 61-62/$3D-$3E) during execution of
the DO statement [$5FE0](4000#5FE0).

## 4630-4631 $1216-$1217 TMPLIN <a name="1216"></a>
### Temporary line number storage for DO
This pair of locations is used to temporarily hold the current
line number value (from 59-60/$3B-$3C) during execution of
the DO statement [$5FE0](4000#5FE0).

## 4632-4634 $1218-$121A USRPOK <a name="1218"></a>
### USR function jump vector
The BASIC function USR calls a machine language routine,
like SYS, but it also allows a numeric value to be passed to
and from the ML routine. The routine in BASIC ROM that executes USR
ends with a JMP $1218. Location 4632/$1218
contains 76/$4C, the machine language JMP instruction. Locations
4633-4634/$1219-$121A should contain the address of
the target machine language routine (in the usual lowbyte/high-byte
format). You must explicitly load these locations with the address of
the target routine before you use
USR. This location is initialized to 32040/$7D28 during
BASIC cold start. This is the address of the routine that issues
the ILLEGAL QUANTITY ERROR message, which is what
you'll get if you use USR without changing locations
4633-4634/$1219-$121A. Refer to Chapter 5 for more information on passing
values to and from the called routine.

## 4635-4639 $121B-$121F RNDX <a name="121B"></a>
### Random number seed value
This five-byte area holds the seed value for BASIC's
randomnumber-generator routine [$8434](4000#8434). When a positive argument
is supplied, the RND routine generates the next random number by
performing calculations and manipulations with the
value here. The generated values aren't really random-any
given seed value here will always produce the same result.
However, the process is sufficiently complicated that the results
aren't easily predictable. Whenever any random number
is generated, the resulting value is stored here for possible use
as the seed for the next random number. Location 4635/$121B
is initialized to 0/$00 during the BASIC cold-start routine.
That is a change from previous Commodore models, where all
five bytes of the seed value were initialized. The zero byte has
the effect of making the initial seed value 0, so the first random
number value generated after the computer is turned on
or after a reset will always be 1.07870447E-03.

## 4640 $1220 CIRCLE_SEGMENT <a name="1220"></a>
### Degrees between segments for CIRCLE routine
This location is used during the BASIC CIRCLE statement routine
[$668E](4000#668E) to hold the number of degrees to turn for each
segment of the circle. The value here is set from the ninth parameter
in the CIRCLE statement, and defaults to 2 if that parameter is omitted.

## 4641 $1221 DEJAVU1 <a name="1221"></a>
Although Commodore literature states that this location holds
a value relating to the reset status, no reference to this location
occurs in any ROM routine.

## 4642 $1222 TEMPO_RATE <a name="1222"></a>
### Tempo setting for PLAY statement
The value here determines the tempo for notes played by the
BASIC PLAY statement. The value here is subtracted from the
sound duration value for each voice (in locations 4643-4648/
$1223-$1228) during each pass through the BASIC IRQ routine. The larger
the value here, the faster the duration decreases and the faster each
note plays. The value here is
initialized to 16/$10 during the SID initialization routine
[$4112](4000#4112), part of both the BASIC cold start and warm start sequences.
In BASIC, the TEMPO statement can be used to
change the value here.

## 4643-4648 $1223-$1228 VOICES <a name="1223"></a>
### Durations for currently active notes
These locations hold the durations of the current PLAY statement notes
for each of the SID chip voices:
* Voice 0: 4643-4644/$1223-$1224
* Voice 1: 4645-4646/$1225-$1226
* Voice 2: 4647-4648/$1227-$1228

Bit 7 of each of the high bytes (4644/$1224, 4646/$1226, and
4648/$1228) is used to indicate whether a note is currently
being played by that voice. The voice is active when that bit is
%0. The duration value for each active voice is decremented
by the tempo value specified in location 4642/$1222 during
each pass through the BASIC IRQ routine [$A84D](4000#A84D). When a
duration is decremented below $0000, the high byte will roll
over to $FF, which will set bit 7 to %1, marking the end of the
note. At this point, the gate bit for the voice will be turned off,
stopping sound output for that voice. Large tempo values
cause the value here to decrease more rapidly, increasing the
speed at which notes are played, while small tempo values increase the note time.
The high bytes for all three voices are set to 255/$FF by
the SID initialization routine [$4112](4000#4112), part of both the BASIC
cold start and warm start sequences. This makes all voices initially inactive.
When the PLAY statement plays a note, the duration for that note will be
copied from 4649-4650/$1229-$122A
into the slot for the voice specified for that note.

## 4649-4650 $1229-$122A NTIME <a name="1229"></a>
### Duration of current note
When the PLAY statement prepares a note, the duration for
the note is first calculated in this location, then transferred to
the proper slot in 4643-4648/$1223-$1228. The value here is
set to 288/$0120, the value for a quarter note, by the SID initialization
routine [$4112](4000#4112), part of both the BASIC cold start
and warm start sequences.

## 4651 $122B OCTAVE <a name="122B"></a>
### Octave for current note
The value in this location determines the octave for the current notes
played by the PLAY statement. This value will affect the calculation
of the frequency for the notes. The value
here is set to 4/$04, the octave containing middle C, by the
SID initialization routine [$4112](4000#4112), part of both the BASIC cold
start and warm start sequences. The octave value here remains
in effect until changed by an 0 parameter in the PLAY string.

## 4652 $122C SHARP <a name="122C"></a>
### Sharp/flat flag
The value in this location holds a value that indicates whether
the current note will be either sharp or flat. The location normally
holds 0/$00 for natural notes. When a # character is
found in the PLAY string, this location will be set to 1/$01 to
indicate that the next note should be sharp. When a $ character is
found in the string, this location will be set to 255/$FF
to indicate that the next note should be flat.

## 4653-4654 $122D-$122E PITCH <a name="122D"></a>
### Frequency for current note
When the PLAY statement prepares a note, the frequency for
the note is calculated in these locations before being transferred
into the SID chip registers for the specified voice. The
frequency is calculated by loading a base frequency for the
specified note from the table at 28665-28688/$6FF9-$7010,
adjusted for the octave specified in 4651/$122B. If the flag at
4652/$122C indicates that the note is to be sharp or flat, the
frequency is adjusted accordingly.

## 4655 $122F VOICE <a name="122F"></a>
### Voice number for current note
The value in this location specifies which voice will be used to
play the next note. The value here is set to 0/$00 by the SID
initialization routine [$4112](4000#4112), part of both the BASIC cold start
and warm start sequences. This selects voice 0 as the default
voice. The value here will remain in effect until changed by a
V parameter in the PLAY string. The parameter value will be
reduced by 1 to convert the BASIC voice number (1-3) to a
VIC voice number (0-2).

## 4656-4658 $1230-$1232 WAVE <a name="1230"></a>
### Waveforms for current notes
The values in these locations determine which waveforms will
be used for each of the three voices:
* Voice 0: 4656/$1230
* Voice 1: 4657/$1231
* Voice 2: 4658/$1232

These locations hold the waveform value for the instrument
specified for the voice. All three voices are initialized to the
default value for instrument O. This selects a default pulse
waveform for all three voices. The value here remains in effect
until changed by a T parameter in the PLAY string. The T parameter
causes the value for the current voice to be changed to
the waveform value for the specified instrument from the table
at 4671-4720/$123F-$1270.

## 4659 $1233 DNOTE <a name="1233"></a>
### Dotted-note flag
The value in this location determines whether the next note
will be normal or "dotted." Dotted notes play Ph times as
long as a standard note. This location normally holds 0/$00,
but will be set to 35/$23 if a period (.) is found in the play
string. In this case, the duration of the next note will be increased 
by 50 percent.

## 4660-4663 $1234-$1237 FILTSAV <a name="1234"></a>
### Temporary storage for filter parameters
The filter parameters are copied here from 4721-4722/
$1271-$1272 at the beginning of the FILTER statement routine
[$7046](4000#7046). 
The filter parameter manipulations are then performed on these 
locations, and the results are copied back to
the working storage area.

## 4664 $1238 FLTFLG <a name="1238"></a>
### Filter type index
This location is used as a mask value to select individual filter
control bits when evaluating the FILTER statement parameters.

## 4665 $1239 NIBBLE <a name="1239"></a>
### Temporary storage
This location is used as working storage by the FILTER and
ENVELOPE routines.

## 4666 $123A TONNUM <a name="123A"></a>
### Current instrument number
This location will hold the instrument number specified in the
most recent ENVELOPE statement. 

## 4667-4669 $123B-$123D TONVAL <a name="123B"></a>
### Envelope parameters for current instrument
The current parameters for the specified instrument are read
from the instrument table into these locations at the beginning
of the ENVELOPE routine [$70C1](4000#70C1):
* Attack/decay: 4667/$123B
* Sustain/release: 4668/$123C
* Waveform: 4669/$123D

If the ENVELOPE statement specifies new values for any of
these parameters, the new values replace the original values
here. The values here are then copied back into the table entries 
for the specified instrument number.

## 4670 $123E PARCNT <a name="123E"></a>
### Index into instrument table for current instrument
This value is used during the ENVELOPE routine [$70C1](4000#70C1) to
hold the index to the current set of instrument parameters. 

## 4671-4720 $123F-$1270 <a name="123F"></a>
### Instrument parameter tables
This area is used to hold the envelope parameters for the ten
defined instruments supported by the PLAY statement [$6DE1](4000#6DE1): 

|Instrument|Attack/Decay|Sustain/Release|Waveform|Pulsewidth low byte|Pulsewidth high byte|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|0|4671/$123F|4681/$1249|4691/$1253|4701/$125D|4711/$1267|
|1|4672/$1240|4682/$124A|4692/$1254|4702/$125E|4712/$1268|
|2|4673/$1241|4683/$124B|4693/$1255|4703/$125F|4713/$1269|
|3|4674/$1242|4684/$124C|4694/$1256|4704/$1260|4714/$126A|
|4|4675/$1243|4685/$124D|4695/$1257|4705/$1261|4715/$126B|
|5|4676/$1244|4686/$124E|4696/$1258|4706/$1262|4716/$126C|
|6|4677/$1245|4687/$124F|4697/$1259|4707/$1263|4717/$126D|
|7|4678/$1246|4688/$1250|4698/$125A|4708/$1264|4718/$126E|
|8|4679/$1247|4689/$1251|4699/$125B|4709/$1265|4719/$126F|
|9|4680/$1248|4690/$1252|4700/$125C|4710/$1266|4720/$1270|

All three voices are initially assigned the envelope parameters
for instrument O. These settings remain in effect until changed
with a T parameter in the PLAY string. 

The values for any table entry can be changed using the
ENVELOPE statement. Default instrument table values are
copied into this area from a table in ROM at 28689-28728/
$7011-$7038 during the SID initialization routine [$4112](4000#4112), part
of both the BASIC cold start and warm start sequences. The
default values are as follows: 

|Envelope|Attack/Decay|Sustain/Release|Waveform|Pulsewidth|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|0 (piano)|9/$09|0/$00|65/$41 (pulse)|1791/$06FF|
|1 (accordion)|192/$C0|192/$C0|33/$21 (sawtooth)|0/$0000|
|2 (calliope)|0/$00|240/$F0|17/$11 (triangle)|255/$00FF|
|3 (drum)|5/$05|80/$50|129/$81 (noise)|0/$0000|
|4 (flute)|148/$94|64/$40|17/$11 (triangle)|255/$00FF
|5 (guitar)|9/$09|33/$21|33/$21 (sawtooth)|0/$0000|
|6 (harpsichord)|9/$09|0/$00|65/$41 (pulse)|767/$02FF|
|7 (organ)|9/$09|144/$90|65/$41 (pulse)|2048/$0800|
|8 (trumpet)|137/$89|65/$41|65/$41 (pulse)|767/$02FF|
|9 (xylophone)|9/$09|0/$00|17/$11 (triangle)|0/$0000|

Note that the pulsewidth values here are different from those
specified in Commodore literature. The official values assume
that all pulsewidth low bytes will be 0/$00. However, these
bytes are not explicitly initialized, so they will hold their 
previous values after a reset. On power on, alternating pulsewidth 
low-byte locations will hold 255/$FF instead of 0/$00.
