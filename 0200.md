# $0200-$02FF - Input Buffer, Common indirect routines, Indirect Vectors

# Input Buffer
## 512-672 $0200-$02A0 BUF <a name="0200"></a>
### BASIC and monitor input buffer
This 161-byte area is used to hold input for both BASIC and
the monitor. The BASIC input routine [$4F93](4000#4F93) allows logical
program lines up to 160 characters long to be entered. A byte
with the value $00 is added following the last character of
the input. If the line starts with a line number, the line here is
tokenized and transferred to the BASIC program text area. An
immediate mode line (one with no line number) is tokenized
and then executed from the buffer. This buffer is also used to
hold input characters for the GET, GET#, GETKEY, INPUT,
and INPUT# statements, which is why those statements are
not allowed in immediate mode. The monitor main loop
[$B08B](B000#B08B) accepts command strings up to 159 characters long,
and also adds a zero byte following the last character of input
to mark the end of the command.

## 673 $02A1 Unused <a name="02A1"></a>
The BASIC and monitor input routines restrict the length of an
input line to 160 characters plus a zero byte to mark the end
of input in the buffer, for a maximum of 161 bytes. Thus, this
location will never be used for input, and is available for other
uses.

# Common Indirect Routines
The routines at $02A2-$02FB are copied here from
Kernal ROM at $F800-$F859 by the routine at
[$E0CD](E000#E0CD), part of the reset sequence. The routines are
placed here in page 2 because this is part of the 1K block of
memory that is visible in all banks. These routines are the key
to the operation of the 128-they make the memory banking
system possible by allowing a routine in one bank configuration to
access data or call routines in another configuration.
For example, these routines allow BASIC ROM routines to use
different blocks of RAM for program text and variables, and to
see program text in areas of RAM that lie at the same addresses as
BASIC ROM itself. These routines are so integral to
the successful operation of the 128 that the system will probably
crash almost immediately if the routines are accidentally
changed or overwritten.

### Retrieves a value from any bank
This routine loads the accumulator value with the contents of
a specified location in any bank. To use this routine, you must
set up a two-byte pointer in zero page to hold the address of
the target location, then store the one-byte address of the
zero-page pointer in location $02AA. You can use the Y
register to specify an offset from the pointer address for the
target location. If no offset is desired, be sure that the Y
register contains $00. The X register should contain the MMU
configuration register setting value which will establish a
memory configuration in which the target location is visible.

The routine reads and stashes the current MMU configuration register
setting, then uses the value in the X register
upon entry as the new configuration register setting. Next, the
contents of the location specified by the address in the pointer
plus the offset in the Y register are loaded into the accumulator.
The MMU configuration register is restored to its original
value before exiting.

This routine is normally called via its related Kernal routine at
[$F7D0](E000#F7D0), which has a jump table entry at
[$FF74](E000#FF74). When calling via the Kernal routine, the accumulator
should contain the zero-page pointer address; the Kernal routine stores
the accumulator value upon entry in 682/$02AA,
performing that setup step for you. The X register should contain a
bank number (0-15) rather than an MMU configuration
register setting value, since the Kernal routine also performs
the chore of converting the bank number into a configuration
register value.

## 687-701 $02AF-$02BD STASH <a name="02AF"></a>
### Stores a value in any bank
This routine stores the contents of the accumulator at a specified location in any bank. Before calling this routine, you must
set up a two-byte pointer in zero page to hold the address of
the target location, then store the one-byte address of the
zero-page pointer in location $02B9. You can use the Y
register to specify an offset from the pointer address for the
target address. If no offset is desired, be sure that the Y register
contains $00. The X register should contain the MMU
configuration register setting value which will establish a
memory configuration in which the target location is visible.

The routine reads and stashes the current MMU configuration register
setting, then uses the value in the X register
upon entry as the new configuration register setting. Next, the
contents of the accumulator upon entry are stored in the location
specified by the address in the pointer plus the offset in
the Y register. The MMU configuration register is restored to
its original value before exiting.

This routine is normally called via its related Kernal routine at
[$F7DA](E000#F7DA), which has a jump table entry at
[$FF77](E000#FF77). When calling via the Kernal routine, the X
register should instead contain a bank number (0-15), since the
Kernal routine performs the chore of converting the bank
number into an MMU configuration register setting value.

## 702-716 $02BE-$02CC CMPARE <a name="02BE"></a>
### Compares accumulator contents against a value from any bank
This routine compares the accumulator value against the contents
of a specified location in any bank. Before calling this
routine, you must set up a two-byte pointer in zero page to
hold the address of the target location, then store the one-byte
address of the zero-page pointer in location $02C8. You
can use the Y register to specify an offset from the pointer
address for the target address. If no offset is desired, be sure
that the Y register contains $00. The X register should contain
the MMU configuration register setting value which will
establish a memory configuration in which the target location
is visible.

This routine reads and stashes the current MMU configuration register
setting, then uses the value in the X register
upon entry as the new configuration register setting. Next, the
value in the accumulator upon entry is compared against the
contents of the location specified by the address in the pointer
plus the offset in the Y register. The MMU configuration register
is restored to its original value before exiting. The status
register value will reflect the result of the comparison.

This routine is normally called via its related Kernal routine at
[$F7E3](E000#F7E3), which has a jump table entry at
[$FF7A](E000#FF7A). When calling via the Kernal routine, the X register
should instead contain a bank number (0-15), since that routine performs
the chore of converting the bank number into an
MMU configuration register setting value.

## 717-738 $02CD-$02E2 JSRFAR <a name="02CD"></a>
### Calls a subroutine in any bank
<span class="badge badge-info">This routine has a Kernal jump table entry at [$FF6E](E000#FF6E)</span>

The routine here will jump to a subroutine at any address in
any standard bank configuration. Upon completion of the target routine,
control is returned to the routine which called
JSRFAR, just like a JSR. However, this routine leaves the system in the
bank 15 configuration, so a routine that uses
JSRFAR must be located in an area of memory visible in the
bank 15 configuration for JSRFAR to properly return to the
calling routine.

Before calling the routine you must load location [$02](0000#02)
with the bank number (0-15) of the target routine and locations
[$03-$04](0000#03) with the address of the target routine. In
contrast to the usuallow-byte/high-byte format, location
$03 should be loaded with the high byte of the address and
location $04 with the low byte. Location [$05](0000#05) should be
loaded with the value you want in the status register when the
target routine is called use $00 if you don't want any status
register bits set. Optionally, you can also load locations
[$06-$08](0000#06) with any values you wish the accumulator, X
register, and Y register, respectively, to have when the target
routine is called.

The routine calls JMPFAR to call the subroutine addressed
in locations [$03-$04](0000#03) in the bank specified in location $02 and with
the status register value specified in location $05 and processor
register values from locations [$06-$08](0000#06). Upon return from the target
routine, the exit values of the accumulator, X register, and Y
register are stored in location [$06-$08](0000#06), respectively. The
value of the status register upon exit from the target routine is
stored in location $05, and the exit value of the processor
stack pointer is recorded in location [$09](0000#09). Finally, the routine
switches the system to the bank 15 configuration before returning to the
calling routine.

## 739-763 $02E3-$02FB JMPFAR <a name="02E3"></a>
### Jumps to a routine in any bank
<span class="badge badge-info">This routine has a Kernal jump table entry at [$FF71](E000#FF71)</span>

The routine here will jump to a routine at any address in any
standard bank configuration. Before calling the routine you
must load location [$02](0000#02) with the bank number (0-15) of the
target routine and locations [$03-$04](0000#03) with the address of
the target routine. In contrast to the usuallow-byte/high-byte
format, location $03 should be loaded with the high byte of
the address and location $04 with the low byte. Location
[$05](0000#05) should be loaded with the value you want in the status
register when the target routine is called (use $00 if you
don't want any status register bits set). Optionally, you can
also load locations [$06-$08](0000#06) with any values you wish the
accumulator, X register, and Y register, respectively, to have
when the target routine is called. The routine pushes the address
and status register values onto the stack, converts the
bank number value to a configuration register value, stores
that value in the MMU configuration register, loads the processor
registers from locations [$06-$08](0000#06), and executes an RTI instruction,
which causes the processor to retrieve status register
and address values from the stack and resume processing at
the specified address.

# Indirect Vectors
The next 66 locations are indirect vectors for a variety of
BASIC, Kernal, and screen editor routines. An indirect vector
is a pair of locations that hold an address for an indirect jump
instruction, such as JMP ($0300). The target address of the
JMP will be determined by the value in the specified indirect
vector. Having ROM routines jump through indirect vectors
greatly increases the flexibility of the computer. Even though it
isn't possible to change a routine in ROM, it's possible to add
to or modify a routine that has an indirect vector by redirecting
the vector to a RAM-based routine.

## 764-765 $02FC-$02FD ESC_FN_VEC <a name="02FC"></a>
### Indirect vector in extended function execution routine

The indirect jump through this vector is taken in the extended
function handling subroutine when a two-byte extended function
token is found for which the second byte is greater than
the largest standard extended function token ($0A). When
the jump is taken, the accumulator will hold the out-of-range
token value and the status register carry bit will be set. If carry
is not clear upon return from the jump, a SYNTAX error message will
be generated. The vector normally holds [$4C78](4000#4C78),
the address of the instruction following the call to this
vector. This doesn't change the carry setting, so out-of-range
extended function tokens normally result in an error message.
If you add new functions to BASIC, you'll need to change this
vector to point to the routine which executes your new function.

## 766-767 $02FE-$02FF BNKVEC <a name="02FE"></a>
### Reserved indirect vector

These two locations are not used by system ROM routines.
Commodore literature indicates that they are reserved for use
as an indirect vector for function ROM routines.
