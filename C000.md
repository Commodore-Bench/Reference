# $C000-$CFFF

Most major screen editor routines can, and should, be entered
through their respective entries in the following jump table.
Each three-byte table entry consists of a JMP opcode followed
by the address of the target routine.

## 49152 $C000 JCINT <a name="C000"></a>
Entry point for the routine at 49275/$C07B which establishes
the default characteristics for both the 40- and 80-column displays.
This entry is part of both the reset and RUN/STOP RESTORE sequences.
No preliminary setup is required, but
the behavior of the routine is affected by the setting of the
initialization status flag (2564/$0A04). The keyboard decoding
table pointers and screen editor indirect vectors are initialized
only when bit 6 of the flag is %0. If you wish to preserve decoding
table pointers or indirect vectors while resetting other
screen editor characteristics, set this bit to %1 before you call
the routine.

## 49155 $C003 JDISPLY <a name="C003"></a>
Entry point for the routine at 52276/$CC34, which deposits a
screen code and attribute value at the current cursor position.
Call this entry with the accumulator holding the screen code
(not the character code) for the desired character and the X
register holding the attribute value for the character.

## 49158 $C006 JKEYIN <a name="C006"></a>
Entry point for the routine at 49716/$C234, which retrieves a
single character from the keyboard. In official Commodore literature,
this routine has the rather nondescriptive name LP2.
This entry is used by the Kernal GETIN routine [SEEEB] when
the keyboard is the input device. (The keyboard, device 0, is
the 128's default input device.) Upon return, the accumulator
will contain the retrieved character. Be sure to see the warning
in the KEYIN entry about calling this routine directly.

## 49161 $C009 JGETSCRN <a name="C009"></a>
Entry point for the routine at 49819/$C29B, which retrieves a
character from a line of keyboard or screen input. In official
Commodore literature, this routine has the rather nondescriptive
name LOOP5. This entry is used by the Kernal BASIN
routine [$EF06] when input is requested from the keyboard
(device 0) or the screen (device 3). The input source is determined
by the value in the flag at [214/$D6](0000#D6). When the flag has
a nonzero value, the character at the current cursor position is
read and returned in the accumulator. When the end of the
line of input is reached, the routine returns the code for the
RETURN character, the value 13/$0D. If the flag is zero, the
routine accepts characters from the keyboard and displays
them on the screen until RETURN is pressed. It then returns
the first character of the input in the accumulator and sets the
source flag to a nonzero value so that subsequent calls retrieve
characters from the input line displayed on the screen. In
either case, the source flag should be set only before the first
call to this routine for any given line of input.

For keyboard input, the starting and ending columns and
the row for the input line are set automatically. For screen input,
the character is read from the row specified in [235/$EB](0000#EB) at
the column specified in [236/$EC](0000#EC). These locations normally
hold the current cursor position and are advanced one position
to the right after each call to this routine. However, the locations
can also be reset to any row and column you desire. The
screen input line ends on the row specified in 2608/$0A30 at
the column specified in [234/$EA](0000#EA). Neither of these locations is
set automatically, so you must specify the ending position
before calling for input from the screen. The X and Y register
contents will be preserved during this routine.

## 49164 $C00C JPRINT <a name="C00C"></a>
Entry point for the routine at 50989/$C72D, which prints a
character at the current cursor position using the current
attribute (in [241/$F1](0000#F1)). This routine is used by the Kernal
BSOUT routine [$EF79] when the screen is specified as the
output device. The screen, device 3, is the 128's default
output device. Call the entry with the accumulator containing the
character code (not the screen code) for the character to be
displayed. The accumulator and X and Y register contents are
preserved during this routine.

## 49167 $C00F JSCRORG <a name="C00F"></a>
Entry point for the routine at 52315/$CC5B, which returns
information about the current window size. This entry is the
target of the Kernal jump table entry SCRORG [$FFED], Upon
return, the X register will hold the number of columns (minus 1)
in the current window, and the Y register will hold the
number of rows (minus 1). The accumulator will hold the
maximum column number for the active screen (39 for the 40-
column display or 79 for the 80-column display).

## 49170 $C012 JSCNKEY <a name="C012"></a>
Entry point for the routine at 50525/$C55D, which scans the
keyboard matrix for a keypress. This entry is the target of the
Kernal jump table entry SCNKEY [$FF9F]. If a key is found to
be pressed, its corresponding character code will be placed in
the keyboard buffer for retrieval by the GETIN or BASIN
routines, unless the key is a shift key or programmable key.
Both of those get special handling (see the SCNKEY routine
for details).

## 49173 $C015 JREPEAT <a name="C015"></a>
Entry point for the routine at 50769/$C651, actually an
alternative entry into the SCNKEY routine. At this point,
the routine expects location [212/$D4](0000#D4) to contain the keyscan matrix
code for the current key, [211/$D3](0000#D3) to hold the status of the
shift keys, and [204-205/$CC-$CD](0000#CC) to point to the keyboard
decoding table selected according to the shift key status. This
table entry is most useful when intercepting the KEYVEC indirect
vector (see the entry at 826/$033A for details).

## 49176 $C018 JPLOT <a name="C018"></a>
Entry point for the routine at 52330/$CC6A, which reads or
sets the cursor position. This entry is the target of the Kernal
jump table entry PLOT [$FFF0], If called with the carry bit
clear, the cursor is moved to the row specified in the X register
and the column specified in the Y register (the row and column
settings are relative to the current home position of the
window). The carry bit will be set upon return if the specified
position is outside the current window boundaries. If called
with the carry set, the routine returns with the row number of
the current cursor position in the X register and the column
number in the Y register (again, the numbers will be relative
to the current home position of the window).

## 49179 $C01B JCRSR80 <a name="C01B"></a>
Entry point for the routine at 52567/$CD57, which moves the
cursor on the 80-column display to the row and column specified in
[235/$EB](0000#EB) and [236/$EC](0000#EC), respectively. The 40-column
display's cursor is maintained by software, so it follows these
pointers automatically, but the position of the 80-column
cursor must be set explicitly.

## 49182 $C01E JESCAPE <a name="C01E"></a>
Direct entry point into the escape sequence handling routine
[$C9BE], Normal entry into the handler begins with an indirect
jump through the ESCVEC vector (824-825/$0338-$0339).
That vector normally points to this table entry, which in turn
jumps back into the handling routine at the point immediately
following the indirect jump.

## 49185 $C021 JKEYSET <a name="C021"></a>
Entry point for the routine at 52386/$CCA2, which redefines
a programmable key. This entry is the target of the Kernal
jump table entry PFKEY [$FF65]. Call this entry with the X
register containing the key number (1-10), the Y register
containing the length of the definition string, and the accumulator
holding the address of a two-byte zero-page pointer to the
string. The zero-page byte immediately following the pointer
should contain the number of the memory bank in which the
string resides.

## 49188 $C024 JSCNIRQ <a name="C024"></a>
Entry point for the routine at 49556/$C194, which handles
the screen editor portion of the IRQ handling sequence. This
includes setting up the screen display mode, scanning the keyboard,
and managing the cursor for 40-column display.

## 49191 $C027 JINIT80 <a name="C027"></a>
Entry point for the routine at 52748/$CE0C, which initializes
the character patterns for the 80-column display. This entry is
the target of the Kernal jump table entry INIT80 [$FF62]. The
routine copies the contents of the 40-column display's character
ROM ($D000-$DFFF in bank 14) into the character definition area
of the 8563 chip's private block of RAM.

## 49194 $C027 JSWAPPER <a name="C027"></a>
Entry point for the routine at 52526/$CD2E, which switches
active screen displays. This entry is the target of the Kernal
jump table entry SWAPPER [$FF5Fj. The routine exchanges
the screen variable tables, tab stop tables, and line link tables,
and toggles the active screen flag ([215/$D7](0000#D7)). This will redirect
printing to whichever screen was previously inactive.

## 49197 $C02D JWINDOW <a name="C02D"></a>
Entry point for the routine at 51739/$CA1B, which sets the
position of a corner of the output window. To set the top row
and left column of the window, call this entry with the carry
bit clear, the accumulator holding the row number, and the X
register holding the column number. To set the bottom row
and right column of the window, call this entry with the carry
bit set, the accumulator holding the row number, and the X
register holding the column number.

## 49200 $C030 Unused <a name="C030"></a>
Three unused bytes filled with the value 255/$FF.

## 49203 $C033 SADDRTBL <a name="C033"></a>
### Table of screen line starting addresses
Locations 49203-49227/$C033-$C04B hold the low bytes of
the address in 40-column screen memory for the column 0 position
in each of the 25 screen lines. Locations
[49228-49252/$C04C-$C064](#C04C)
hold the high bytes for the line addresses for
the default 40-column screen position (at 1024/$0400). These
table values are used in conjunction with the screen base addresses,
2619/$0A3B for the 40-column screen or $2606/$0A2E
for the 80-column screen, to calculate the actual starting address
for each line of screen and attribute memory.

## 49253 $C065 SCNVCTRS <a name="C065"></a>
### Table of default screen editor indirect vectors
The five two-byte values here are copied to the screen editor
indirect vector table at 820-829/$0334-$033D when the system
is reset. In each case, the default indirect vector merely returns
control to the location immediately following the indirect jump,

## 49263 $C06F KEYPTRS <a name="C06F"></a>
### Table of default keyboard decoding table pointers
The six two-byte values here, the addresses of the ROM keyboard
decoding tables, are copied to the keyboard decode
pointer table at 830-841/$033E-$0349 when the system is
reset.

## 49275 $C07B CINT <a name="C07B"></a>
Initializes screen editor constants, variables, tables, and vectors.
This routine has a screen editor jump table entry at 49152/$C000
and a Kernal jump table entty at 65409/$FF81.
Sets the default values for all working storage memory locations used
by screen editor routines. This routine is part of
both the reset and RUN/STOP-RESTORE sequences. The CIA
chip register (56576/$DD00) that controls VIC-II chip memory
banking is set to have the VIC-II see memory from its bank 0,
corresponding to addresses 0-16383/$0000-$3FFF in block 0
of system RAM (VIC-II banks are different from MMU banks;
see Chapter 8 for more details). Bit 1 of the processor I/O
register (1/$01) is set to %1 to make block 1 of color memory
(the block for 40-column text screen color) visible at
55296/$D800. The Kernal CLRCH routine [$FFCC] is called to
reset normal I/O sources: input from the keyboard and output
to the screen. The SID chip volume register (54296/$D418) is
set to zero to silence any sound output (a step not present in
the Commodore 64's CINT routine). Screen editor RAM variables
and constants are initialized as follows:

|Location|Value|Meaning|
|-|-|-|
|208/$D0|0|Keyboard buffer empty|
|209/$D1|0|No function key pending|
|214/$D6|0|Input from the keyboard|
|216/$D8|0|40-column display set for text mode|
|217/$D9|0|CHAREN shadow cleared|
|2592/$0A20|10/$0A|Maximum of 10 keys in buffer|
|2593/$0A21|0|Printing pause flag cleared|
|2594/$0A22|128/$80|All keys repeat if held down|
|2595/$0A23|4/$04|Delay between repeats initialized|
|2596/$0A24|10/$0A|Delay before repeats initialized|
|2598/$0A26|0|40-column cursor will blink|
|2599/$0A27|10/$0A|Cursor blink switch initialized|
|2600/$0A28|10/$0A|Cursor blink countdown initialized|
|2603/$0A2B|96/$60|80-column cursor set for blinking block|
|2604/$0A2C|20/$14|40-column text screen and character base initialized (screen at 1024/$0400, character set seen at 4096/$1000)|
|2605/$0A2D|120/$78|40-column bitmap and matrix base initialized (matrix at 7168/$1C00, bitmap at 8192/$2000)|
|2606/$0A2E|0|Base page for screen memory in 8563 RAM (screen at 0/$0000)|
|2607/$0A2F|8/$08|Base page for attribute memory in 8563 RAM (attributes begin at 2048/$0800)|
|2612/$0A34|208/$D0|Default raster line for split screen (text portion starts at line 20)|
|2619/$0A3B|4/$04|Base page for 40-column screen memory (value read from 49228/$C04C)|

Also during this setup, the active screen flag (215/$D7) is
set for 40-column mode, and bit 7 of the MMU mode configuration
register (54533/$D505) is set to %1 to enable reading of
the 40/80 DISPLAY key. While the 40-column display is active, default
tab stops are set and default screen editor variables are copied from
the table at 52852/$CE74 into 224-249/$E0-$F9. At the same time,
default variables for the 80-column display are copied from the table
at 52878/$CE8E into
2624-2649/$0A40-$0A59. However, there is a bug in this
portion of the routine: The copy loop uses an index of 26/$1A
instead of the proper value 25/$19, so the byte following the
40-column table is also copied to 250/$FA, and the byte following
the 80-column table is also copied to 2650/$0A5A.
The screen editor indirect vectors (820-829/$0334-$033D) are
initialized from the table at 49253/$C065.

Next, bit 6 of the initialization status flag (2564/$0A04) is
checked. If the bit is set to %1 , the following steps to load
keyboard table pointers and key definition strings are skipped.
If the bit is clear, the keyboard decoding table pointers
(830-841/$033E-$0349) are initialized from the table at
4926/$C06F, and the default programmable key definitions
are copied to the definition area at 4096/$1000 from the table
at 52904/$CEA8. After the values are copied, bit 6 of the flag
is set to %1 to indicate that these steps have been performed.
The flag is cleared before this routine is called by the reset
routine [$E000], so these steps will always be performed during
a reset. However, the RUN/STOP-RESTORE sequence
[$FA53] does not affect the flag, so any changes to programmable
key definitions or keyboard decoding table pointers will remain
intact after RUN/STOP-RESTORE.

Default tab stops are then established for the 80-column
screen, and the 80-column window is reset to full screen size
and cleared. The 40-column window is also reset to full screen
size and cleared. Finally, the position of the 40/80 DISPLAY
key is read (by checking bit 7 of 54533/$D505), and the selected
display will become the active screen upon exit.

## 49474 $C142 CLEAR <a name="C142"></a>
Clears the current window and homes the cursor.
Also handles clear screen character, CHR$(147).
Sets the cursor to the home position and clears rows until the
bottom of the window is reached, then falls through into the
following routines to return the cursor to the home position
and set pointers.

## 49488 $C142 HOME <a name="C150"></a>
Moves the cursor to the home position of the current window.
Sets the cursor row ([235/$EB](0000#EB)) and starting row for input
([232/$E8](0000#E8)) to the top row of the current window ([229/$E5](0000#E5)),
and the cursor column ([236/$EC](0000#EC)) and starting column for input
([233/$E9](0000#E9)) to the left margin of the current window
([230/$E6](0000#E6)), then falls through into the next routine to set
pointers to that line.

## 49500 $C15C SETLINE <a name="C15C"></a>
Sets starting address pointers for the current line.
Loads the line number where the cursor currently resides
([235/$EB](0000#EB)) into the X register, then falls through
into the next routine to set pointers to that line.

## 49502 $C15E SETADDR <a name="C15E"></a>
Sets starting address pointers for a specified line.
Calculates the screen memory address corresponding to the
leftmost column of the screen line specified in the X register
and places the address in the pointer at [224-225/$E0-$E1](0000#E0).
The low byte of the address comes from the table at 49203/$C033
(multiplied by 2 if the 80-column display is active). The
high byte is calculated by taking a value from the table at
49228/$C04C, masking off all but the lowest two bits (and
multiplying the result by 2 if the 80-column screen is active),
then ORing the result with the starring page value for the active
screen 2619/$0A3B for the 40-column display or
2606/$0A2E for the 80-column display.

Next (at 49532/$C17C), the attribute memory address
corresponding to the leftmost column of the specified screen
line is calculated and placed in the pointer at [226-227/$E2-$E3](0000#E2).
The low byte of the address is taken directly from
the low byte of the screen memory pointer ([224/$E0](0000#E0)).
For the 40-column screen, the high byte is calculated by masking off
all but the lowest two bits of the screen memory pointer high
byte ([225/$E1](0000#E1)), then ORing the result with the value
[216/$E8](0000#E1)216/$D8 (40-column color memory always starts
at $D800). For the 80-column screen, the high byte is
calculated by masking off all but the lowest three bits of the
screen memory pointer high byte ([225/$E1](0000#E1)), then ORing
the result with the attribute memory starting page value (2607/$0A2F).

## 49556 $C194 SCNIRQ <a name="C194"></a>
Performs screen and keyboard portion of IRQ functions.
This routine has a jump table entry at 49188/$C024.
Begins by checking whether the current IRQ is the result of a
raster interrupt.
If it's not, then this can't be a normal jiffy IRQ, so the routine
skips the screen setup steps and just scans the keyboard and
blinks the cursor before exiting. If it is a raster interrupt, the
routine checks whether the screen mode flag (216/$D8) contains
the value 255/$FF. If so, the routine again skips ahead to
scan the keyboard, blink the cursor, and exit. The 128 itself
never puts that value into the flag, but you can use this feature
when you set up your own custom screen mode or raster
interrupt (see the entry for location 216/$D8 for details).

The routine then checks whether the raster is currently on
scan line 256 or higher. If so, the interrupt occurred while the
raster was beyond the visible portion of the screen. This offscreen
raster interrupt is the normal jiffy IRQ source for the
128—quite a different technique from the CIA timer-driven
jiffy IRQ for the Commodore 64. The interrupt is actually
triggered at line 255, but the raster will have moved to the
next scan line by the time its position is checked here. For an
offscreen interrupt, the VIC-II chip registers will be set according
to the screen mode flag value, using the step at 49631/$C1DF
for mode 0 (a full text screen) or the one at 49587/$C1B3
for a bitmapped or split-screen mode.

If the interrupt occurred above scan line 255, bit 6 of the
screen mode flag is tested. If that bit is set to %1 , a split
screen mode is in use, so a branch is taken to 49631/$C1DF
to set VIC-II registers for the text portion of the display.
Otherwise, the registers are merely reset for whichever mode
is currently in use, which produces no obvious effect.

At 49587/$C1B3, the bitmapped or multicolor bitmapped
screen is established. If a split screen is in use, the scan line
value for the split, stored in 2612/$0A34, is loaded into the
VIC-II's raster compare register ([53266/$D012](D000#D012)). The processor
I/O register ([1/$01](0000#01)) is set to make block 0 of color memory—
the block for multicolor source 3—visible at 55296/$D800,
and the VIC memory control register ([53272/$D018](D000#D018)) is loaded
with the bitmap base address, stored in 2605/$0A2D. Bit 5 of
VIC control register 1 ([53265/$D011](D000#D011)) is set to %1 to enable
the bitmapped display. If the mode flag indicates that multicolor
bitmapped mode was selected, bit 4 of VIC control register 2
([53270/$D016](D000#D016)) is also set to %1 to enable that feature.

At 49631/$C1DF, the 40-column text screen (or the text
area of a split screen) is established. The VIC-II's raster
compare register ([53266/$D012](D000#D012)) is loaded with 255/$FF to trigger
the offscreen raster interrupt. The processor I/O register
([1/$01](0000#01)) is set to make block 1 of color memory—the block for
40-column text color—visible at 55296/$D800, and the VIC
memory control register ([53272/$D018](D000#D018)) is loaded with the
screen and character memory base value, stored in $2604/$0A2C.
The VIC control register bits for bitmapped and multicolor
are cleared to disable those display modes. Finally, a
short delay loop is executed if the text portion of a split screen
is being established. This is to insure that the switch from
bitmapped to text modes occurs while the raster is off the right
edge of the visible screen area, which prevents the flicker that
would occur if the change occurred in the middle of scanning
a line.

If the IRQ source is a raster interrupt which occurred on
the visible screen (to set up the text portion of a split screen),
the routine exits at this point with the status register carry bit
clear. In all other cases, the routines to scan the keyboard for a
keypress [$C55D] and handle 40-column cursor blinking
[$C6E7] are called, and the carry bit will be set upon exit.

## 49716 $C234 KEYIN <a name="C234"></a>
Performs GETIN from keyboard.
This routine has a jump table entry at 49158/$C006.
Checks [209/$D1](0000#D1) to see whether any characters remain to be
read from the definition string for the most recently pressed
programmable key. If so, a character is read from the definition
area, with the value in 210/$D2 used as an offset from
the start of the definition area (4106/$100A). The count of remaining
characters is decremented and the offset into the definition area
is incremented; then the routine exits with the
character in the accumulator, the status register carry bit clear,
and IRQ interrupts reenabled.

If no programmable key string characters are pending, the
character at location 842/$034A, the first character in the
keyboard buffer, is returned in the accumulator. Any remaining
characters in the buffer are shifted one position to the left to
remove the retrieved character from the buffer; then the count
of characters in the buffer (208/$D0) is decremented. Upon
exit, the status register carry bit will be clear and IRQ
interrupts will be reenabled.

Unlike other major screen editor routines with jump table
entries, you should avoid calling this one directly. To retrieve
keypresses, call the Kernal GETIN routine via its jump table
entry (65508/$FFE4) with the current input device ([153/$99](0000#99))
set to zero to indicate keyboard input. The Kernal GETIN routine
[$EEEB] verifies that a character is waiting to be read from
either a programmable key string or the keyboard buffer
before it calls this routine. If you call this routine with no
characters available (with [208/$D0](0000#D0) and [209/$D1](0000#D1)
both containing
zero), you'll cause serious problems. The contents of
all page 3 locations above the keyboard buffer (and part of 40-
column screen memory in page 4) will be garbled. This area
includes the vital indirect fetch and store routines; you'll have
to reset the computer to recover.

## 49752 $C258 KEYLIN <a name="C258"></a>
Accepts a line of keyboard input and returns the first character.
The normal entry point for this routine is 49755/$C25B.
Turns on the cursor, then waits until a character is available in
the keyboard buffer or from a programmable key definition
string. The routine above is called to retrieve the character,
and unless it's a RETURN character, code 13/$0D, the routine
loops to display the character on the screen at the current
cursor position (using the PRINT routine [$C72D]), move the
cursor to the next position, and wait for another character to
become available. When RETURN is encountered, the routine
falls out of this loop and stores the RETURN code in the input
source flag ([214/$D6](0000#D6)) so that subsequent calls to the keyboard
BASIN routine will retrieve characters from the line of input
that has been displayed on the screen. The routine then sets
pointers to the input screen line and jumps to
[49852/$C2BC](#C2BC)
in the following routine to exit with the accumulator holding
the first character of the input—unless no other characters
were typed before RETURN, in which case the routine
branches to [49829/$C2A5](#C2A5) in the following routine to exit with
the RETURN character code in the accumulator.

## 49819 $C29B GETSCRN <a name="C29B"></a>
Performs BASIN from screen or keyboard.
This routine has a jump table entry at 49161/$C009.
Stashes the contents of the X and Y registers on the stack for
later restoration, then checks the input source flag ([214/$D6](0000#D6)).
If the flag value is zero, indicating input from the keyboard,
the preceding routine is used to accept a line of input from the
keyboard. If the flag is nonzero, but with bit 7 clear (%0), the
routine branches ahead to 49852/$C2BC to retrieve a character
from a screen line. If bit 7 is set (%1), the end of the input
line has been reached, so (at 49829/$C2A5) the input source
flag is reset to zero and a RETURN character is printed unless
output is to a device other than the screen. The routine then
exits with the RETURN character code, 13/$0D, in the accumulator
(the X and Y registers will be restored to their original
values).

At 49852/$C2BC, the screen code at the current cursor
position is retrieved and converted into the corresponding
character code (disassemble $C2C2-$C2D8 to see the conversion process).
The routine then checks whether the end of input has been reached.
If so, bit 7 of the input flag is set to %1
to indicate that all characters have been read from the current
input line.

The cursor is then moved right to the next character position
in the line. If the calculated character code is 222/$DE,
the pi (K) character, it's replaced with 255/$FF, an alternative
value (and BASIC token) for that character. Before exiting, the
original X and Y register values placed on the stack at the start
of the routine are restored, and retrieved character code is
loaded into the accumulator. The status register carry bit will
be clear upon exit.

Although there are no bugs in this routine, its calling
Kernal routine (BASIN [$EF06]) will not correctly retrieve a
line of input from the screen (keyboard input functions properly).
The screen input setup portion of BASIN has two major
flaws: It does not set the ending row for input (2608/$0A30),
and it resets the input source flag ([214/$D6](0000#D6)) before
each character is retrieved (so that the setting of bit 7 is lost). Together,
these bugs make it impossible to determine when the end of
the input is reached. The following is an example of the
proper technique for retrieving a line of input from the screen:

``` Assembly
      LDA $EB       // Set ending row for input
      STA $0A30     // (same as starting row)
      LDA $E7       // Set ending column for input
      STA $EA       // (to right window margin)
      LDA #$03      // Set screen as input source
      STA $D6       // (any nonzero value will do)
      LDX #$00      // Initialize storage offset
LOOP  JSR $C009     // Read character from the screen
      CMP #$0D      // Is it RETURN?
      BEQ EXIT      // Exit if so
      STA $0C00,X   // Stash character from screen
      INX           // increment the offset
      BNE LOOP      // Loop for another character
EXIT  RTS
```

## 49919 $C2FF QUOTECK <a name="C2FF"></a>
Handles quote mode flag.
Checks whether character value in the accumulator is 34/$22,
the quote (") character. If so, bit 1 of the quote mode flag
([244/$F4](0000#F4)) is toggled, turning quote mode on if it was previously
off or off if it was previously on. The character value
will still be in the accumulator upon exit.

## 49932 $C30C PRNTEXIT <a name="C30C"></a>
Provides common exit for screen BSOUT subroutines.
Stores the current character code (239/$EF) as the previous
character code (240/$F0). The subroutine to move the cursor
on the 80-column screen [$CD57] is called to actually move
the cursor if that display is active. This is necessary because
the 80-column screen's cursor is controlled by hardware (not
by software, like the 40-column screen's cursor), so it doesn't
automatically move when its corresponding row and column
pointers are updated. The pending insert count (245/$F5) is
checked. If it's nonzero, the quote mode flag is cleared. As a
result, you won't go into quote mode if you type the quote
character for a pending insert unless the quote is typed for the
last insert. Before exiting, the routine reloads the accumulator
and X and Y registers with the values stored on the stack
when the BSOUT routine was entered [$C72D], so all register
values are preserved during BSOUT. The status register carry
bit will be clear upon exit.

Because the address of this routine is pushed onto the
stack at the start of the screen BSOUT routine [$C72D], all
screen printing subroutines will return to the calling routine
via this routine.

## 49952 $C320 SETCHAR <a name="C320"></a>
Handles character printing for screen BSOUT.
Handles all character display functions for the screen BSOUT
routine [$C72D], including quote, reverse, and autoinsert
modes. The routine has several entry points, depending on the
desired effect. For any of these entry points, the code to be
printed should be in the accumulator upon entry:

**49952/$C320**: Entry point for printing character codes
160-254/$A0-$FE. Prior to entry, bit 7 of the code will have
been cleared to %0. This step forces bit 6 to %1, so character
codes 160-191/$A0-$BF become screen codes 96-127/
$60-$7F, and character codes 192-254/$C0-$FE become
screen codes 64-126/$40-$7F.

**49954/$C322**: Entry point for printing character codes
32-127/$20-$7F. Prior to entry, the character code will have
been converted to a screen code by the screen BSOUT control
routine [$C72D]. This step checks whether reverse mode is active (indicated by a nonzero value in [243/$F3](0000#F3)). If that mode is
not active, the next step is skipped.

**49958/$C326**: Entry point for printing characters in reverse
video; also used for character codes less than 32 and for codes
128-159 when those characters are printed in quote mode or
at a pending insert. For codes 1-31/$01-$1F, the character
code is used unchanged, so those characters are represented
by the reverse images of screen codes 1-31/$01-$1F. For characters 128-159/$80-$9F, bit 7 will have been cleared to %0,
and bit 6 set to %1 prior to entry, so those characters are represented by the reverse images of screen codes 64-95/$40-$5F.

If autoinsert mode is active (indicated by bit 7 of 246/$F6
set to %1), a space is inserted at the current cursor position
before the character is printed. (The count of inserts pending is
also cleared; you can't have inserts pending in autoinsert
mode.) The subroutine at 52271/$CC2F is used to place the
character on the screen at the current cursor position using the
current attribute value from [241/$F1](0000#F1); then the routine falls
through into the following one to move the cursor to the next
position.

## 49982 $C33E UDCRSR <a name="C33E"></a>
Updates the cursor position.
Compares the current cursor column (in the Y register upon
entry) against the right window margin ([231/$E7](0000#E7)). If the
cursor is at the right edge of the window, the routine checks
whether the cursor is also already on the bottom line of the
window. If so, the scrolling enable flag ([248/$F8](0000#F8)) is checked.
The cursor will not be moved if scrolling is not allowed when
the cursor reaches the lower right corner of the window. Otherwise, the cursor is moved right one position. If the cursor
moves beyond the right window margin, a new blank line is
inserted and linked to the one above, and the cursor is moved
to the left margin of this new line. However, linking can be
disallowed by setting bit 6 of [248/$F8](0000#F8) to %1. In this case, the
cursor will simply wrap around to the left margin without inserting a new line. This link-disable feature is not directly supported on the 128—there's no character or ESC sequence to
disable linking—so you must set or clear the bit directly. See
the entry for location [248/$F8](0000#F8) for details.

## 50019 $C363 NEXTLIN <a name="C363"></a>
Moves the cursor down one line.
Moves the cursor down to the next row in the window. If the
cursor is already on the bottom row of the window, the scrolling enable flag ([248/$F8](0000#F8)) is tested. If scrolling is allowed, the
window contents are scrolled upward by one row, and the
bottom row (where the cursor now resides) is cleared. If scrolling is disabled, the cursor is wrapped to the top row of the
window.

## 50044 $C37C OPENLIN <a name="C37C"></a>
Inserts a new line linked to the one above.
Copies all lines in the window below the one on which the
cursor currently resides down one row (the bottom line will be
lost). The line on which the cursor resides is then cleared and
linked to the one above.

## 50086 $C3A6 SCROLL <a name="C3A6"></a>
Scrolls the window up one line.
Copies all lines in the window up one row. The top line will
be lost and the bottom line will be cleared. If the new top line
was originally linked to the line scrolled off the window, it
will be unlinked.

## 50140 $C3DC SCRLUP <a name="C3DC"></a>
Copies lines up one row and clears bottom line.
Copies all lines in the window below the one specified in the
X register up one row. The specified line will be overwritten,
and the bottom line will be cleared and unlinked. The line
link bits for each line are also copied to the new positions so
that the links will be maintained intact.
This routine also checks column 7 of the keyboard matrix
(see the entry at [50525/$C55D](#C55D)) to test the Commodore key. If
that key is found to be pressed, a delay loop is executed. Since
this is the subroutine used to open new lines at the bottom of
the window while printing, this feature allows the Commodore key to slow screen scrolling. There is no simple way to
defeat this feature.

## 50189 $C40D MOVLINE <a name="C40D"></a>
Copies a line.
Copies characters from the line specified in the X register to
the one pointed to in [224-225/$E0-$E1](0000#E0), and copies the attributes for the line to the attribute line pointed to in [226-227/$E2-$E3](0000#E2). The copying begins at the column specified in the Y
register and extends to the left window margin. The copy is
performed on whichever display, 40- or 80-column, is currently active. The X register will still contain the source line
number upon exit.

## 50189 $C4A5 CLRLINE <a name="C4A5"></a>
Clears a line.
Writes a space character with the current attribute (from
[241/$F1](0000#F1)) at every character position between the left and right
window margins of the line specified in the X register. The operation is performed on whichever display, 40- or 80-column,
is currently active. The link bit for the line is also cleared, unlinking the line. Upon exit, the X register will still contain the
line number and the Y register will hold the column number
of the right window margin.

## 50492 $C53C FILLSRAM <a name="C53C"></a>
Fills or copies a block of 8563 RAM.
Uses the hardware fill/copy feature of the 8563 chip to fill or
copy a block of the 8563's private 16K of RAM. The block
starts at the address currently in 8563 registers 18-19/$12-$13
and ends at the address in 2620-2621/$0A3C-$0A3D. The operation is determined by the state of bit 7 of 8563 register
[24/$18](0000#18). If the bit is %0, the block is filled with the value in
8563 register [31/$1F](0000#1F). If the bit is %1, the contents of locations
starting at the address in registers [32-33/$20-$21](0000#20) are copied
to the block.

## 50525 $C55D SCNKEY <a name="C55D"></a>
Scans keyboard matrix for keypress.
(This routine has a screen editor jump table entry at 49170/$C012
and a Kernal jump table entry at 65439/$FF9F.)
Begins by checking bit 6 of location l/$01 to determine the
position of the CAPS LOCK key. If that key is down, the shift
key flag ([211/$D3](0000#D3)) will be set to 16/$10 (bit 4 set to %1);
otherwise, it will be cleared to zero. Next, the keyscan code
([212/$D4](0000#D4)) is initialized to 88/$58, the value for no key
pressed. The keyboard matrix is checked to see whether any
keys are pressed. If not, the routine jumps to 50839/$C697 in
the next routine to set 88 as the matrix code value. If a key
has been pressed, the routine loads the keyboard decode table
pointer ([204-205/$CC-$CD](0000#DC)) from 830-831/$033E-$033F,
which holds the address of the default table, and begins the
process of determining which key is being pressed.
The keyboard is arranged electrically as a matrix of 11
columns and eight rows (next figure). To scan for a keypress,
the CIA or VIC port bit for one of the 11 columns is set to %0,
while the bits for all other columns are held at %1 . While the
column bit is %0, the CIA port for the eight rows ([56321/$DC01](DC00#DC01))
is read, and, one by one, the bits corresponding to the
rows are tested. The count of scanned keys is incremented
after each row bit is tested, so each key in the matrix has a
keyscan code corresponding to the number of keys scanned
when that key's position is tested. The codes range from 0, for
the key at row 0 of column 0 (INST/DEL), to 87, for the key
at row 7 of column 10 (NO SCROLL).

![Keyboard matrix](./resources/007-01-f-keyboard-matrix.png)

Several keys on the 128 keyboard are not included in the
keyscan matrix. The CAPS LOCK key (read at bit 6 of location
[1/$01](0000#01)) is tested at the start of this routine. The 40/80 DISPLAY key (read at bit 7 of location [54533/$D505](D500#D505)) is tested
during the screen initialization routine [$C07B]. The SHIFT
LOCK key is a switch that has the effect of holding down the
left SHIFT key. The RESTORE key isn't read at all; it's connected to circuitry which generates an NMI interrupt signal to
the processor when the key is pressed (see the NMI handling
routine [$FA40]).

If the key at the intersection of the row and the column
being tested is pressed, the row bit will be %0; otherwise, it
will be %1. If a key is found to be pressed, the character code
for the key is read from the default decode table. Unless the
character code read from the table is 8, 4, 2, or 1, the keyscan
code (not the character code) for the key is stored in [212/$D4](0000#D4),
and the routine goes on to scan the next position. However, if
the character code has one of these values, that value is ORed
with the shift key flag to set a bit in the flag value.

Note that it's the keyboard decode table, not the physical
keyboard layout, that determines which keys are treated as
shift keys. In the default ROM keyboard decode table at
64128/$FA80, the ALT key (keyscan code 80) decodes as
character code 8, the CONTROL key position (keyscan code
58) holds character code 4, the Commodore logo key position
(keyscan code 61) holds character code 2, and the left and
right SHIFT key positions (keyscan codes 15 and 52, respectively) both hold character code 1. Thus, pressing either SHIFT
key normally sets bit 0 of [211/$D3](0000#D3) to %1, and the Commodore, CONTROL, and ALT keys set bits 1, 2, and 3, respectively. (You can change this by modifying the default
keyboard table. See the entry at 830-831/$033E-$033F for
more information.) Since the matrix code isn't stored when
these shift keys are processed, [212/$D4](0000#D4) will never contain 15,
52, 58, 61, or 80 while the standard decode table is being
used. So the SHIFT, ALT, Commodore, and CONTROL keys
can't normally be detected by checking [212/$D4](0000#D4). Their states
must be determined from [211/$D3](0000#D3).

All eight rows in each of the 11 columns are scanned, whether keypresses
are detected or not. Since there's only one location ([212/$D4](0000#D4)) for
storing the matrix code, only the key with the highest code value
will be recorded if more than one key is detected during the scan.
However, because of the way the keyboard is wired, a false value
may be returned if three or more keys are held down simultaneously.
For example, if you hold down the J, K, and L keys simultaneously,
the matrix code returned will be 45, the code for the colon (:) key.
Thespecial shift keys are an exception: [211/$D3](0000#D3) will show the state
of all five (SHIFT, Commodore, CONTROL, ALT, and CAPS LOCK) on
every keyscan.
