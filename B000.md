# $B000-$BFFF - Monitor Jump Table

The duplicate use of the word monitor in computer terminology
may be confusing at first. The term can refer to either hardware,
a dedicated video screen used to display information
from the computer, or software, a program used to examine
and modify the contents of memory. Once you understand the
difference, the meaning of monitor is usually obvious from the
context. This chapter describes the 128's built-in software monitor,
which resides in the 4K block of ROM from 45056-49151/
$BOOO-$BFFF. In addition to examining and changing memory,
this monitor allows you to assemble, disassemble, and execute
ML routines; examine and change microprocessor register contents;
and copy, compare, save, load, and verify blocks of
memory.

Like the 128's BASIC, its machine language monitor has a
long heritage from previous Commodore models. All of the
original CBM models (except for very early PETs) included a
rudimentary monitor in ROM which allowed users to examine
and modify memory and registers, execute ML programs, and
load and save data, but had no provision for assembling or
disassembling machine language.

The VIC-20 and Commodore 64 had no monitor in builtin ROM, but
sophisticated monitors for both were available on
cartridge. A number of public-domain RAM-resident monitors
were also available, most notably Supermon and Micromon.
Finally, the Plus/4 and 16 once again included a monitor
program in ROM, a version called Tedmon.

The 128's monitor shares many characteristics with all of
its predecessors, but it includes a number of enhancements as
well. One of the most notable is that it allows the entry of
numbers in decimal, octal, or binary in addition to hexadecimal.
Whenever the monitor expects a number, you can use a
decimal value if it's prefixed with a + character, or a binary
number if it's prefixed with a % character (in the rare case
when you might want to use an octal-base 8-number, pre
fix it with an ampersand, &). If no prefix is used, then hexadecimal
is assumed. (Hex can also be explicitly specified by
using a $ character as a prefix.)

## Moving Between BASIC and the Monitor
In general, the monitor is aloof from the rest of the 128 ROM
routines. Unlike BASIC-which in a number of places bypasses the
Kernal jump table and calls Kernal routines directly-the monitor
calls all the Kernal routines it uses
through their formal jump table entries. Neither BASIC nor
the Kernal calls any monitor routines other than through jump
table entries. The monitor does not make use of any BASIC
ROM routines or data tables and for the most part does not
interfere with memory locations used by BASIC. Thus, you may
pass freely back and forth between the monitor and BASIC
without fear of upsetting the BASIC program currently in
memory. This greatly enhances the monitor's function as a debugging tool.

One notable-and highly unfortunate-exception to this
independence from BASIC is that the monitor uses addresses
in the range 96-104/$60-$68 as working pointers in most operations.
This area includes the addresses used by BASIC for
its floating-point accumulator 1 (FAC1), where the results of
mathematical operations are stored. As a result, it is impossible
to use the 128's monitor to directly examine or change the
contents of FACl. This severely limits the usefulness of the
monitor for experimenting with BASIC floating-point routines.

One other overlap between BASIC and the monitor is that
the two share the same input buffer area for accepting and
processing commands (512-673/$0200-$02A1). Thus, it is not
possible to use the monitor to examine the BASIC input buffer
contents or to manipulate data in the input buffer, since the
buffer will be at least partially overwritten by the monitor
command to display or change the memory area.

## Memory Management
Another particularly attractive feature of the 128's monitor is
the ease with which it interfaces with the computer's memory
management system. Addresses in monitor commands are
specified as five-digit hexadecimal values, where the first digit
refers to the bank and the remaining four specify the address
within the bank. Monitor commands that accept a range of addresses
can span banks-T E0000 E0FFF 1C000, for example.
Thus, the monitor can effectively see the 16 separate banks as
a single 1024K (16 * 64K) block of memory. One exception is
the F (fill memory) command, which cannot cross bank boundaries, because doing so would overwrite the vital contents of
locations $00 and $01.

The fact that the monitor can see the 128's memory as a
continuous block has an important consequence for the H
(hunt for byte pattern) command. Remember that the banks
are not really 16 separate blocks of memory, but rather 16
different arrangements of the available RAM and ROM. The
lowest 1K of memory (including the input buffer at 512/$0200) is
common to all banks, and at least the lower 4K of block 0
RAM (including the buffer at 2688/$0A80, where the search
pattern is stored) appears in all even-numbered banks and in
banks 13/$0 and 15/$F.

Thus, if you search any bank from beginning to end (for
example, H 10000 1FFFF 'C-128), you'll always find at least
one match for your search pattern-in the input buffer at
$0200, where the search command is stored. If you search any
even-numbered bank from beginning to end, you'll find at
least two matches for your search pattern-once in the input
buffer at $0200 and again in the search buffer at $OA80. And
if you search all banks from beginning to end (for example, H
00000 FFFFF 'COMPUTE!), then you'll always find at least 26
matches because of all the times the memory areas used by
the input buffer and search buffer appear in the different
banks. It's important to choose your address range carefully
when searching for a byte pattern.

A final note on banks and the monitor: If no bank is explicitly
specified, bank 0 is assumed. This is different from
BASIC, which retains the setting specified in a previous BANK
statement, starting with a default of bank 15. So when using
the monitor, you must always explicitly specify the bank if
you wish to use any bank other than bank O. It is particularly
important to remember this when using the G and J commands, lest
you send the processor off to some uncharted region of memory.

For the programmer wishing to make use of ROM
routines, those in the monitor are generally less useful than
those in the BASIC, screen editor, and Kernal portions of the
ROM. The monitor JMPs rather than JSRs to the routines used
to perform monitor commands, so most major routines end by
jumping directly back to the monitor's main loop rather than
with an RTS opcode. You probably wouldn't want to incorporate
calls to such routines in your own programs because the
routines never return from the monitor. However, the main
command execution routines use a number of subroutines that
do end with RTS opcodes, and you may find some of these
useful, particularly the routines to convert and print byte
values as decimal numbers (at 47623/$BA07 and 47687/$BA47)
or as hexadecimal numbers (at 47250/$B892).

# Monitor Jump Table
Like the BASIC, screen editor, and Kernal jump tables, each
three-byte entry in the following table consists of a JMP
opcode followed by the address of an important routine.

## 45056 $B000 JMONINIT <a name="B000"></a>
### Monitor cold-start entry point
<div class="tooltip_code" onclick="loadDisasmCode('disasm\\disasm-B000.html');">Disassembled code</div>
<span class="badge badge-info">Jumps to [$B021](#B021)</span>

Enters the monitor with default microprocessor register values.
This is the entry point when the RUN/STOP key is held
down during power-on/reset, or when the MONITOR command is executed in BASIC.

## 45059 $B003 JMONBRK <a name="B003"></a>
### Monitor break entry point
<div class="tooltip_code" onclick="loadDisasmCode('disasm\\disasm-B003.html');">Disassembled code</div>
<span class="badge badge-info">Jumps to [$B009](#B009)</span>

Enters the monitor with the current program counter, bank, and
microprocessor A, X, and Y register values preserved. The
monitor is normally called via this entry point whenever a
BRK opcode is executed because the Kernal RESTOR routine
[$E056](E000#E056), part of the RESET sequence, initializes the CBINV
vector at [$0316-$0317](0300#0316) to point here. CBINV determines
where control is passed after a BRK.

## 45062 $B006 JIMONRTN <a name="B006"></a>
### Reentry point from the IMON indirect vector.
<div class="tooltip_code" onclick="loadDisasmCode('disasm\\disasm-B006.html');">Disassembled code</div>

Like the BASIC
and Kernal indirect vectors, the monitor's command execution
routine has an indirect vector, IMON ([$032E-$032F](0300#032E)),
which is initialized by the Kernal RESTOR routine [$E056](E000#E056) to
point here. From this point, control is transferred back to
[$B0B2](#B0B2) in the main loop, the address immediately following
the IMON jump. See IMON for information on how
the indirect vector can be used to wedge in additional monitor
commands.

## 45065 $B009 MONBRK <a name="B009"></a>
### Monitor entry routine when BRK instruction encountered
<div class="tooltip_code" onclick="loadDisasmCode('disasm\\disasm-B009.html');">Disassembled code</div>

Prints BREAK and a {BELL} character, then retrieves and
stores the bank number, program counter, and microprocessor
register values that were placed on the stack by the IRQ/BRK
handling routine [$FF17], then branches into the following
routine to fall through to the register display and main loop.

## 45089 $B021 MONINIT <a name="B021"></a>
### Cold-start routine for monitor
<div class="tooltip_code" onclick="loadDisasmCode('disasm\\disasm-B021.html');">Disassembled code</div>
Switches to bank 15, loads all register storage locations with
zeros, sets the program counter storage to $B000 and bank
storage to 15, and prints MONITOR. Next (at $B046) the stack
pointer is stored and Kernal error messages are enabled. The
routine then falls through to display the stored register values
and enter the main loop.

## 45136 $B050 SHOVVREG <a name="B050"></a>
### Handles R (register display) command
<div class="tooltip_code" onclick="loadDisasmCode('disasm\\disasm-B050.html');">Disassembled code</div>

Prints a heading for the register display, then displays the contents
of the storage locations (2-9/$02-$09) that represent the
program counter (prefixed with the current bank number); status;
and A, X, Y, and stack pointer register values. The storage locations
are filled upon entry to the monitor and can be changed
with the register change (;) command. To simplify the process
of changing register values, this routine adds a semicolon before
the displayed values so that you can change the stored values
by typing over the displayed values and pressing RETURN.
The routine ends by falling through into the main loop.

## 45195 $B08B MONMAIN <a name="B08B"></a>
### Main command execution loop for the monitor.
<div class="tooltip_code" onclick="loadDisasmCode('disasm\\disasm-B08B.html');">Disassembled code</div>

Clears a line for input, then gets a command line into the input buffer
([$0200-$02A0](0200#0200)). The routine accepts characters until RETURN is
pressed. Characters are then retrieved
from the buffer until one is found that is not a space. This
character is assumed to be a monitor command (all monitor
commands consist of a single character). With this character in
the accumulator, the routine jumps through the IMON indirect
vector at [$032E-$032F](0300#032E). Normally, this vector points
to the jump table entry at [$B006](#B006), which immediately returns
to the address following the indirect jump. However, this
vector can be changed to allow additional commands to be added
to the monitor. See the discussion at IMON for more details.

The routine then compares the command character in the
accumulator against characters from the command table at
[$B0E6](#B0E6). If no match is found, an error is assumed, and
(at $B0BC) the error signal (a question mark) is printed following
the command. The routine then loops back to process another command.
If a match is found among the first 15 characters in the command
table, then the command is executed
by pushing an address from the table at [$B0FC](#B0FC) onto
the stack, then jumping to read the parameter following the
command. The RTS at the end of the parameter decoding routine
[$B7A7](#B7A7) will cause control to be passed to the command
execution address stored on the stack. If the matching
character is among characters 16-19 in the table ($-%), then a jump
is taken to the base conversion routine [$B9B1](#B9B1). If the
matching character is among characters 20-22 in the table (L-V),
then a jump is taken to the routine that prepares for load,
save, or verify [$B337](#B337).

## 45283 $B0E3 EXITMON <a name="B0E3"></a>
### Handles X (exit to BASIC) command.
<div class="tooltip_code" onclick="loadDisasmCode('disasm\\disasm-B0E3.html');">Disassembled code</div>

Leaves the monitor and returns to BASIC by jumping indirectly
through BASIC's restart vector at 2560-2561/$0A00-$0A01.

## 45286 $B0E6 COMTBL <a name="B0E6"></a>
### Table of monitor commands.
<div class="tooltip_code" onclick="loadDisasmCode('disasm\\disasm-B0E6.html');">Disassembled code</div>

Each of the 22 commands consists of a single character:
ACDFGHJMRTX@.>;$ + &%LSV

## 45308 $B0FC EXECTBL <a name="B0FC"></a>
### Table of execution addresses for the monitor commands.
<div class="tooltip_code" onclick="loadDisasmCode('disasm\\disasm-B0FC.html');">Disassembled code</div>

Each two-byte entry in the table consists of the address minus
1 of the routine to perform the corresponding command. The
entries are one less than the actual address because of the way
the RTS opcode behaves: When RTS pulls a return address
from the stack, it adds 1 to the address value before placing
the value in the 8502's program counter. The actual execution
addresses for each of the commands handled by this table are
as follows:

||||
|-|-|-|
|A|(Assemble instruction)|$B406|
|C|(Compare memory blocks)|$B231|
|D|(Disassemble instruction)|$B599|
|F|(Fill memory)|$B3DB|
|G|(Go to routine)|$B1D6|
|H|(Hunt for byte)|$B2CE|
|J|(Jump to subroutine)|$B1DF|
|M|(Memory display)|$B152|
|R|(Register display)|$B050|
|T|(Transfer memory)|$B234|
|X|(eXit to BASIC)|$B0E3|
|@|(send disk command)|$BA90|
|.|(same as A)|$B406|
|>|(change memory)|$B1AB|
|;|(change register)|$B193 |

## 45338 $B11A MINDFET <a name="B11A"></a>
### INDFET call for the monitor.
<div class="tooltip_code" onclick="loadDisasmCode('disasm\\disasm-B11A.html');">Disassembled code</div>

Calls the Kernal INDFET routine [$FF74] to retrieve a
character into the accumulator from the bank specified in 104/$68 at
the address pointed to in 102-103/$66-$67, and with the
offset specified by the contents of the Y register. The use of
$66-$68 as working addresses makes it impossible to use the
monitor to examine the contents of floating-point accumulator
1 (FAC1), since the value in FAC1 will be changed by the
monitor M command (which uses this routine).


## 45354 $B12A MINDSTA <a name="B12A"></a>
### INDSTA call for the monitor.
<div class="tooltip_code" onclick="loadDisasmCode('disasm\\disasm-B12A.html');">Disassembled code</div>

Calls the Kernal INDSTA routine [$FF77] to store the value in
the accumulator into the bank specified in 104/$68 at the
address pointed to in 102-103/$66-$67, and with the offset
specified in the Y register. The use of $66-$68 as working
addresses makes it impossible to use the monitor to load values
directly into floating-point accumulator 1 (FAC1), since the
value in FAC1 will be changed by the> (memory change)
command (which uses this routine).

## 45373 $B13D MINDCMP <a name="B13D"></a>
### INDCMP call for the monitor.
<div class="tooltip_code" onclick="loadDisasmCode('disasm\\disasm-B13D.html');">Disassembled code</div>

Calls the Kernal INDCMP routine [$FF7A] to compare the
value in the accumulator against the value at the address
pointed to in 102-103/$66-$67, with the offset specified in
the Y register, from the bank specified in 104/$68. The only
monitor routine that uses indirect comparison is the
compare/transfer routine [$B321](#B321), and that routine calls
INDCMP directly, using instead 96-97/$60-$61 as the address pointer
and 98/$62 for the bank value.

## 45394 $B152 SHOWMEM <a name="B152"></a>
### Handles M (memory display) command.
<div class="tooltip_code" onclick="loadDisasmCode('disasm\\disasm-B152.html');">Disassembled code</div>

Displays the contents of a specified area of memory as
hexadecimal values and ASCII characters. The routine functions by
repeatedly calling the subroutine display lines of byte and
character values [$B1E8](#B1E8).

The format depends on the screen mode: 8 bytes per line
in 40-column mode or 16 bytes per line in 80-column mode.
No parameters are required, but either one or two parameters
can be specified. If no parameters are specified, the display
begins at whatever address is currently in 102-103/$66-$67
from the bank specified in 104/$68. Before other operations
are performed, the value in those locations is not predictable.
After another M command, these locations will hold an address
one line (8 or 16 bytes) higher than the previous ending
address. Twelve lines of data will be displayed, representing
either 96 bytes (40-column mode) or 192 bytes (80-column
mode). If one address is specified, 12 lines are displayed
starting at the specified address. If two addresses are specified, all
bytes between the addresses are displayed; the NO SCROLL
key may be used to pause the screen and the STOP key will
halt the process. The routine always displays full lines, so a
few bytes beyond the specified ending address may also be
shown. It is possible to wrap from bank to bank; the next
address after $FFFF in one bank is $0000 in the next higher
bank. Thus, the M command treats the 16 banks like a
continuous block of memory. However, the address will not wrap
from $FFFFF to $00000. The routine ends by jumping back to
the main loop [$B08B](#B08B).

## 45460 $B194 CHNGREG <a name="B194"></a>
### Handles ; (change register) command.
<div class="tooltip_code" onclick="loadDisasmCode('disasm\\disasm-B194.html');">Disassembled code</div>

Allows you to change the contents of the bank, program
counter, and register storage locations (2-9/$02-$09). Since
the values in the storage locations are reloaded into the
corresponding registers by the G and J commands, this allows
you to change values that the various microprocessor registers
will hold when ML routines are executed from the monitor.
The register contents are usually changed by editing the
values displayed by the R (register display) command [$B050](#B050).
Since that routine automatically provides the semicolon (;) in
front of the values, you may not even have realized that this
is a separate command. You are free to use the ; command
independently of the register display, but it is somewhat less
convenient.

The routine expects to read the values in order, so you
must supply values for all registers with storage locations
lower than the one you wish to change. This isn't a problem if
you're editing the register display, but if you're using the;
(semicolon) command independently, you must supply values
for all registers that are normally displayed to the left of the
value you wish to change. For example, even if you want to
change only the Y register value, you must still also supply
address, status register, accumulator, and X register values (in
order) before the Y register value.

## 45483 $B1AB CHNGMEM <a name="B1AB"></a>
### Handles > (change memory) command.
<div class="tooltip_code" onclick="loadDisasmCode('disasm\\disasm-B1AB.html');">Disassembled code</div>

Allows you to change the contents of one or more memory locations -
to a maximum of either 8 or 16 locations, depending
on whether the 40- or 80-column screen is in use. Memory
contents are usually changed by editing the lines of byte values
displayed by the M (memory display) command [$B152](#B152).
Since that routine automatically provides the> in front of the
address and values, you may not even have realized that this
is a separate command. You are free to use the> command
independently of the memory display; in fact, it's more
convenient when you need to change only one or two bytes.
If no parameters are found following the > command,
then a line of byte values is displayed beginning at the address
in [$66-$67](0000#66) from the bank in [$68](0000#68). If no
monitor commands involving ranges of addresses-for example,
M, T, or C-have yet been performed, the value in
these locations is unpredictable. Following the M command,
the locations will hold an address one line (8 or 16 bytes,
depending on the display width) higher than the address of the
last line displayed.

Only hexadecimal byte value parameters can be interpreted;
you cannot change memory by changing the ASCII
characters displayed at the end of each line. The routine to
display a line of memory [$B1E8](#B1E8) is called to redisplay the
changed locations. A full line (8 or 16 bytes) is always
redisplayed, even if you have changed only one or two bytes.
The routine ends by jumping back to the main loop [$B08B](#B08B).

## 45526 $B1D6 GOTOLOC <a name="B1D6"></a>
### Handles G (go to routine) command.
<div class="tooltip_code" onclick="loadDisasmCode('disasm\\disasm-B1D6.html');">Disassembled code</div>

Loads the bank and program counter storage locations
([$02-$04](0000#02)) with the specified values if a target address is supplied.
The stack pointer is restored to the value it had upon
entry to the monitor (stored in 9/$09). This negates the effects
of any stack operations the monitor routines may have performed.
Finally, the Kernal JMPFAR routine [$FF71] is called
to transfer control to the address specified in 3-4/$03-$04,
and in the bank specified in 2/$02, with the microprocessor
registers loaded from [$05-$08](0000#05).

There's normally no returning from a JMPFAR. If you
want to get back to the monitor after executing an ML routine
using G, then the routine at the target address must end with
a BRK ($00) opcode. Execution of the BRK will return you to
the monitor via the break entry point [$B003](#B003).

If you use G to go to a routine that ends with an RTS,
you'll be returned to BASIC at the end of the routine. If you'd
prefer to be returned to the monitor when a program terminates
with RTS, use J instead of G.

## 45535 $B1DF JMPSUB <a name="B1DF"></a>
### Handles J (jump to subroutine) command.
<div class="tooltip_code" onclick="loadDisasmCode('disasm\\disasm-B1DF.html');">Disassembled code</div>

Loads the bank and program counter storage locations
([$02-$04](0000#02)) with the specified values if a target address
is supplied. The Kernal JSRFAR routine [$FF6E] is called to transfer
control to the address specified in 3-4/$03-$04, and in the
bank specified in 2/$02, with the microprocessor registers
loaded from 5-8/$05-$08. Upon return from the JSRFAR, the
routine jumps back to the main loop [$B08B](#B08B).

To get back to the monitor cleanly after using J, you'll
need to be sure that the routine at the target address ends
with an RTS opcode. Execution of a BRK opcode will also
cause a return to the monitor (via the break entry point
[$B003](#B003)), but in that case the JSRFAR return address will be
left on the stack.

## 45544 $B1E8 SHOWLIN <a name="B1E8"></a>
### Displays a line of memory as hex bytes and ASCII characters.
<div class="tooltip_code" onclick="loadDisasmCode('disasm\\disasm-B1E8.html');">Disassembled code</div>

Clears a screen line, then prints a > character to facilitate use
of the memory change command [$B1AB]. Next, the bank and
address of the first location in the current display line (in
102-104/$66-$68) are printed. A loop reads bytes from memory and
prints two-digit hexadecimal numbers representing
the byte values. The loop repeats for either 8 or 16 bytes,
depending on the screen width (determined by checking the
value in 215/$07). After this, the routine prints a colon (so
that the following ASCII characters will not be counted as part
of the input for the memory change command) and an {RVS}
character (so that the following ASCII characters will be
displayed in reverse video). Finally, a second loop is used to read
the same 8 or 16 bytes again, but this time to display the
equivalent ASCII character for the byte value. To prevent
cursor or color control characters from being printed and
upsetting the screen display, the character code for the period (.)
is substituted if the byte value to be displayed is less than
32/$20 or between 128-159/$80-$9F.

## 45617 $B231 CMPXFR <a name="B231"></a>
### Compares or transfers blocks of memory.
<div class="tooltip_code" onclick="loadDisasmCode('disasm\\disasm-B231.html');">Disassembled code</div>

Begins by loading an operation flag (147/$93) with a value
that indicates which function is being performed: 0/$00 if the
routine is entered at $B231 for C (compare) or 128/$80 if entered
at $B234 for T (transfer). The transfer operation might
more properly be called a copy, because the contents of the
source block of memory are not changed unless the blocks
overlap. A direction flag (2739/$0AB3) is also used during
transfers to indicate whether bytes are being copied downward
in memory (flag value 0/$00) or upward (flag value 128/$80).
The direction of a transfer is significant-downward moves
must work from the starting address toward the ending address,
while upward moves must work from end to start. Otherwise,
if the source and destination ranges overlap, a single
value would be rippled through the destination range.

The routine loads bytes from the source address range
and, if a transfer operation is indicated, stores the value in the
corresponding destination address using the Kernal INDSTA
routine [$FF77]. Next, it compares the byte in the source range
against the byte in the destination range using the Kernal
INDCMP routine [$FF7A]. This performs the compare operation
(the bytes should always be equal for a transfer operation). If
the bytes do not match, the address of the mismatch is
printed. Then the source and destination addresses are either
incremented (for a compare or downward transfer) or decremented
(for an upward transfer). This loop is repeated until all
bytes in the range have been compared or transferred; then
the routine jumps back to the main loop [$B08B](#B08B). However,
the loop also includes a call to the Kernal STOP routine
[$FFE1], so the RUN/STOP key can be used to halt the compare or transfer.
