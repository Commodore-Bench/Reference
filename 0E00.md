# $0E00-$0FFF - Sprite Pattern Storage Area

# Sprite Pattern Storage Area 

## 3584-4095/$0E00-$0FFF <a name="0E00"></a>
This area is reserved by the system to hold sprite pattern definitions.
Each sprite pattern requires 64 bytes and must start at
an address which is an exact multiple of 64/$40. Other free
locations within the current video bank which meet these criteria can
also be used for sprite pattern storage, but BASIC
sprite routines such as SPRSAV and SPRDEF assume that
sprite patterns reside in this area. The sprite pointers for the
default screen memory position (2040-2047/$07F8-$07FF) are
initialized during the BASIC cold-start sequence as follows:

|Pattern area|Pointer value|Default sprite|
|-|-|-|
|3584-3647/$0E00-$0E3F|56/$38|0|
|3648-3711/$0E40-$0E7F|57/$39|1|
|3712-3775/$0E80-$0EBF|58/$3A|2|
|3776-3839/$0EC0-$0EFF|59/$3B|3|
|3840-3903/$0F00-$0F3F|60/$3C|4|
|3904-3967/$0F40-$0F7F|61/$3D|5|
|3968-4031/$0F80-$0FBF|62/$3E|6|
|4032-4095/$0FC0-$0FFF|63/$3F|7|

No system ROM routines change these settings. If your program
doesn't require sprites, this area can be used for other
purposes such as to hold machine language routines.
