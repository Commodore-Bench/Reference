### Shadows for VIC sprite position registers

The contents of these locations are copied into the VIC chip
sprite position registers ([53248-53264/$D000-$D010](D000#D000)) during
each pass through the BASIC IRQ routine [$A84D]. As long as
the BASIC IRQ routine is active, the VIC registers cannot be
changed directly. Instead, you should store the desired register
value in the corresponding shadow location. All locations in
this range are initialized to 0/$00 during the BASIC cold-start
sequence. The values here can be set using the MOVSPR
statement. The MOVSPR routine [$6CC6] sets the value here
directly when a static|Sprite position is specified. When a moving|Sprite is specified, the movement information is stored in
the table at [4478-4565/$117E-$11D5](117E#117E) and the values here are
updated during each pass through the BASIC IRQ routine
[$A84D]. The locations are used as follows:

|Location|Register|Function|
|-|-|-|
|4566/$11D6|53248/$D000|Sprite 0 horizontal position|
|4567/$11D7|53249/$D001|Sprite 0 vertical position|
|4568/$11D8|53250/$D002|Sprite 1 horizontal position|
|4569/$11D9|53251/$D003|Sprite 1 vertical position|
|4570/$11DA|53252/$D004|Sprite 2 horizontal position|
|4571/$11DB|53253/$D005|Sprite 2 vertical position|
|4572/$11DC|53254/$D006|Sprite 3 horizontal position|
|4573/$11DD|53255/$D007|Sprite 3 vertical position|
|4574/$11DE|53256/$D008|Sprite 4 horizontal position|
|4575/$11DF|53257/$D009|Sprite 4 vertical position|
|4576/$11E0|53258/$D00A|Sprite 5 horizontal position|
|4577/$11E1|53259/$D00B|Sprite 5 vertical position|
|4578/$11E2|53260/$D00C|Sprite 6 horizontal position|
|4579/$11E3|53261/$D00D|Sprite 6 vertical position|
|458O/$11E4|53262/$D00E|Sprite 7 horizontal position|
|4581/$11E5|53263/$D00F|Sprite 7 vertical position|
|4582/$11E6|53264/$D010|Most significant bits of horizontal position|

### Shadows for VIC sprite-collision registers

During any pass through the BASIC IRQ routine [$A84D]
where either or both of the sprite-collision latch flags {bits 1-2
of [53273/$D019](D000#D019)) are found to be set to %1, the contents of
the corresponding VIC chip sprite-collision register will be recorded in these locations. For sprite-foreground collisions (indicated when bit 1 of the flag is set), any bits in the register at
[53279/$D01F](D000#D01F) which are set to %1 will also be set to %1 in location 4584/$11E8. Likewise, for sprite-sprite collisions (indicated when bit 2 of the flag is set), the %1 bits in the register
at [53278/$D01E](D000#D01E) will be recorded in location 4583/$11E7.

Thus, these locations will accumulate collision readings until
they are cleared, rather than simply holding the most recent
collision values. The routine for the BASIC function BUMP
[$837C] returns values based on the contents of these locations, rather than on the actual register contents. BUMP(1) returns the sprite-sprite collision value in 4583/$11E7, and
BUMP(2) returns the sprite-foreground collision value in
4584/$11E8. Either location will be reset to 0/$00 after being
read by BUMP. Both locations are also initialized to 0/$00
during the BASIC cold-start sequence.

### Shadow for VIC light pen registers

During any pass through the BASIC IRQ routine [$A84D]
where the light pen latch flag (bit 3 of [53273/$D019](D000#D019)) is found
to be set to %1, the contents of the VIC chip light pen registers at [53267-53268/$D013-$D014](D000#D013) will be copied into these
locations. The routine for the BASIC function PEN [$82AE] returns values based on the contents of these locations, rather
than on the actual register contents. PEN(0) returns the value
in 4585/$11E9, multiplied by 2. PEN(1) returns the value in
4586/$11EA. Either location will be reset to 0/$00 after being
read by PEN. Both of these locations are also initialized to
0/$00 during the BASIC cold-start sequence.
