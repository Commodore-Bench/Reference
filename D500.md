### Configuration register 

The value in the configuration register determines which of
the available memory resources will be visible to the
microprocessor at any given time. However, this particular
register is only rarely used-not at all in 128 ROM except during MMU register initialization-because it has an identical
twin at address 65280/$FF00 which is more convenient. There
is really only one configuration register; it just appears at two
different addresses. The register is accessible here only when
the I/O block is visible, whereas it is always accessible at
65280/$FF00, regardless of the memory configuration. As a 
result, memory configuration is usually done with the higher
configuration register location. Refer to the entry (below) for
the other configuration register for details of the function of
the register bits. 

This register is initialized during the Kernal RESET routine [$E000] to 0/$00, the setting for the bank 15 configuration. However, that step of the routine is redundant because
the same value has previously been stored in 65280/$FF00.
Reading this register returns the current configuration setting,
regardless of whether the setting has been established by writing to this register or to 65280/$FF00.

### Preconfiguration register 

These registers provide an indirect method of setting up a
memory configuration. Whenever a value-any value-is
stored in one of the four load configuration registers at
65281-65284/$FF01-$FF04, the value in the corresponding
pre configuration register is transferred to the configuration
register. Thus, the pre configuration registers allow you to set
up as many as four different memory configurations, each of
which can then be established with a single store operation.
The bit functions for pre configuration register locations are the
same as for the configuration register. For details, see the entry
below for 65280/$FF00. 

The Kernal RESET routine [$E000] initializes all the preconfiguration registers to 0/$00, the setting for the bank 15
configuration. The preconfiguration/load configuration register
memory management technique is not used by the operating
system. However, BASIC ROM routines do make use of this
method. The BASIC cold start [$4023] and warm start [$4009]
routines both initialize the preconfiguration registers as follows:

|Register|Setting|Bank configuration|
|-|-|-|
|54529/$D501|63/$3F|0|
|54530/$D502|127/$7F|1| 
|54531/$D503|1/$01|14|
|54532/$D504|65/$41|A custom setting with the same visible ROM as bank 14, but with RAM from block 1 instead of block 0|

In a number of instances in BASIC ROM you'll find instructions like STA $FF03, where BASIC is using this shortcut
method of bank selection. 

Because BASIC depends on standard values in the preconfiguration registers, it's generally best to avoid changing the
register settings in machine language programs which must
work in conjunction with BASIC. To reset the preconfiguration
registers to their default values without performing the entire
BASIC warm start or cold start sequence, call the BASIC ROM
subroutine at 16762/$417 A. Of course, if BASIC is not being
used, you're free to use the pre configuration registers to set up
any memory configuration you desire.

### Mode configuration register 

The primary function of this register is to select the current
operating mode from the three possibilities-128, 64, or CP/M. 

**Bit 0**: This bit determines which microprocessor is in control
of the system. Writing a %0 here puts the Z80 in command,
while writing a %1 switches to the 8502. Since this bit is reset
to %0 when the system is reset or powered on, the Z80 always has control of the system before the 8502. The reset sequence in Z80 ROM is nearly identical to that in 128 mode
ROM, including checking for the presence of Commodore 64
cartridges and testing whether the Commodore key is held
down for Commodore 64 mode. If the Z80 reset routine does
not find a CP/M boot disk in the drive (or a Commodore 64
cartridge or the Commodore key held down), it jumps to a
routine it has copied into 65504/$FFEO in block 0 RAM. That
routine ends by setting this bit to % 1 to return control to the
8502 for 128 mode. 

Switching processors is not for the faint of heart. When
you activate the Z80, it will begin executing instructions at
whatever address is currently in its program counter registers.
The address in those internal processor registers can't be
changed from 128 mode, so you're stuck with having the Z80
take up wherever it left off when the system was switched to
128 mode. This address is usually 65518/$FFEE, the location
following the one where 128 mode was activated at the end of
the Z80's reset routine. In block 0 RAM, that location is initialized with a Z80 instruction (RST1) to perform a warm start of
CP/M mode. If you don't have a valid Z80 machine language
instruction there when you activate the Z80-for example, if
the system is in a memory configuration such as bank 15
where 128 Kernal ROM is seen at that address-you'll probably experience an immediate system lockup. 

**Bits 1-2**: Unused. These bits always return %1 when read,
and writing to these bits has no effect.

**Bit 3**: This bit is connected to the MMU pin labeled FSDIR.
This line is bidirectional, meaning that it can be both an input
and an output. The 128 uses the line only as an output, to
control the direction of data flow on the fast serial bus. The
lines of the slow serial bus are each controlled by a pair of
CIA chip lines, one for input and one for output, but the fast
serial bus uses the same CIA chip lines for both input and output. The 128's designers added additional circuitry which insures that the fast serial bus will ignore incoming data during
fast serial output. The FSDIR (fast serial direction) line controls
that circuitry. Writing a %0 to the bit pulls the line to a low (0
volts) state, which sets the fast serial bus for input. Writing a
%1 to the bit allows the line to go to a high (+5 volts) state,
which sets the fast serial bus for output. The IOINIT routine
[$E109] leaves this bit set to %0 so that the system can detect
fast serial input. The setting of this bit is controlled in Kernal
ROM by the routines SPIN [$E5C3] and SPOUT [$E5D6].

**Bits 4-5**: These bits are connected, respectively, to the MMU
pins labeled GAME and EXROM, which in the 128 are connected to the memory expansion port lines with the same
names. These MMU lines are bidirectional, meaning that they
can be both inputs and outputs. The 128 uses the lines only as
inputs, to read the state of the memory expansion port lines
(pins 8 and 9 of the port). Writing to one of the bits sets the
corresponding line's output level. Writing a %0 to the bit pulls
the line to a low (0 volts) state, while writing a %1 to the bit
allows the line to go to a high (+5 volts) state. When used for
input, an external device connected to the line can pull the
line low if its output level is set high, but cannot bring the line
high if its output level is set low, so writing a %0 to one of
these bits effectively blocks the use of the line as an input.

The Kernal RESET routine [$E000] initializes both of these
bits to % 1 so that they can be used to read the state of the
port lines. In 128 ROM, these bits are read during the reset sequence by the routine which checks for the presence of a
Commodore 64 ROM cartridge [$E242]. Almost all Commodore 64 cartridges ground one or both of these port lines, so
the 128 will assume that a 64 cartridge is present if either of
these bits is found to be %0, and will respond by switching to
Commodore 64 mode. 

While the system is in 128 mode, you can use these bits
to control the corresponding expansion port pins as either inputs or outputs. Keep in mind, however, that the pins must be
high during reset or the system will enter Commodore 64 mode. 

**Bit 6**: This bit controls which set of ROMs will be visible to
the system. Writing a %0 here selects the 128 mode ROM set,
while writing a % 1 selects the Commodore 64 mode ROM.
The 128 mode RESET routine [$E000], of course, initializes
this bit to %0. However, simply writing a % 1 here won't
cause a clean transfer to 64 mode; it's necessary to perform
the 64 mode reset sequence after the 64 mode ROM is selected. See the C64_MODE routine [$E24B] for details. This
bit has one other effect-selecting 64 mode also makes all the
MMU chip registers invisible, so once you make the jump to
64 mode there is no way back to 128 mode short of resetting
the computer or turning it off and back on. 

**Bit 7**: This bit is connected to the MMU pin labeled 40/80.
This line is bidirectional, meaning that it can be both an input
and an output. The 128 uses the line only as an input, to read
the 40/80 DISPLAY switch on the 128's keyboard. Writing to
the bit sets the state of the line output. Writing a %0 to the bit
pulls the line to a low (0 volts) state, while writing a % 1 to
the bit allows the line to go to a high (+ 5 volts) state. The
switch connected to the line can pull the line low if its output
level is set high, but cannot bring the line high if its output
level is set low. Thus, writing a %0 to this bit effectively
blocks the reading of the 40/80 DISPLAY switch. The CINT
screen editor initialization routine [$C07B], part of both the reset and RUN/STOP-RESTORE sequences, sets this bit to %1
to insure that the switch can be read. The bit returns a %0
when read while the switch is down (80-column position), or
a % 1 while the switch is up (40-column position). In 128
ROM, this bit is read only during the CINT routine, where its
setting is used to determine which display to make active.

### RAM configuration register 

An important aspect of the MMU's memory configuration capabilities is its ability to create common areas of RAM, areas
where the same RAM is seen regardless of the configuration
register selection. Kernal routines copied into the default common area allow the processor to jump from bank to bank, or
to manipulate data in other banks. This register controls the
common RAM feature, and also specifies which RAM block
the VIC video banks are seen in. 

**Bits 0-3**: These bits control the common RAM feature. Bits 0-1
control the size of the common areas, and bits 2-3 control
whether the common areas will exist at the top, bottom, or
both top and bottom of the RAM blocks. (No RAM will be
common if bits 2-3 are set to %00.) When common RAM is
specified, the RAM seen as common is always that from block
O. As long as the common RAM feature is enabled, there is no
way for the processor to access the RAM in block 1 which is
covered by the common area. When a common area at the top
of memory is selected, it will be visible only when bits 4-5 of
the configuration register are set to make RAM visible at the
top of memory.

There are a few exceptions to the common RAM rules.
First, locations 0-1/$00-$01, the 8502 on-chip I/O port, and
locations 65280-65284/$FF00O-$FF04, the upper MMU registers, always appear in any configuration, regardless of the
setting of these bits. That is, there is no way to make the processor see anything other than the hardware registers in these
locations (at least not while the computer is operating in 128
mode). Second, the area where the two lowest pages of memory are seen is also affected by the registers at 54535-54538/
$D507-$D50A. Even if you change the page pointers at
54535/$D507 or 54537/$D509 to physically move zero page
or page 1 somewhere in memory outside the common area,
the contents of those pages will still appear to be common as
long as a common area at the bottom of memory is selected. If
you disable the common area at the bottom of memory, all
references to zero page and page 1 will continue to affect only
block a RAM unless you specifically change the block pointers
for those pages in the registers at 54536/$DF08 and 54538/$DFOA. Finally, you should be aware that the common area
setting does not affect the RAM block from which the VIC
chip sees its video bank. The VIC's RAM block is determined
by bits 6-7 of this register, and all RAM in the VIC bank is
seen in the block specified in those bits without regard for the
common area specification. The VIC chip can see the memory
that is hidden from the processor. 

The four possible selections for the size of the common
areas are as follows: 
|Bits 1 0|Size of common areas|
|-|-|
|0 0|1K|
|0 1|4K|
|1 0|8K|
|1 1|16K|

The four possible selections for location of the common
areas are as follows: 
|Bits 3 2|Location of common areas|
|-|-|
|0 0|No common RAM|
|0 1|Common area at bottom of memory|
|1 0|Common area at top of memory|
|1 1|Common areas at both top and bottom of memory|

The default value in these bits, established during the Kernal
RESET routine [$E000], is %0100 = $4. This setting selects a
1K common area at the bottom of memory, addresses 0-1023/
$0000-$03FF. The proper functioning of both the operating
system and BASIC depends on the presence of this common
area, so you should change the setting of these bits with great
care. BASIC is almost certain to crash if the common area is
disabled altogether. The operating system will crash if an interrupt occurs while the system is  configured for block 1 RAM
with the common area disabled.

You can manipulate these bits to gain temporary access to
the 1K of RAM from block 1 which is normally hidden by the
standard common area, but making any practical use of the
hidden area is more than a little complicated. The standard interbank data transfer routines like INDFET and INDSTA can't
be used because they depend on the common area. Furthermore, the machine language routine you write to perform the
transfer can't use any zero-page locations, nor can it use jumps
to subroutines or other instructions which would affect the
stack (page 1). Interrupts must also be disabled while the common area is disabled. The following routine swaps the contents of the hidden block 1 area with the contents of the next
higher 1K area of block 1 (addresses 1024-2047/$0400-$07FF).
Note that this routine must be placed in block 1 RAM

TBD

**Bits 4-5**: These two bits are not used in the current version of
MMU. The design specifications for the chip indicate that in
future versions these bits may be used in a "superbanking"
scheme to select one of four separate 256K blocks of RAM in a
1M (one-megabyte, or 1024K) system. It's a tantalizing prospect, but there's no guarantee that a Commodore 1024 will
ever be produced. In the current MMU, the bits will retain
whatever value is written to them, but changing the bit
settings has no effect on the memory configuration. The bits
are initialized during the Kemal RESET routine [$E000] to %00

**Bits 6-7**: These bits determine which 64K block of RAM the
VIC video bank is located in. (See the section on the VIC chip
earlier in this chapter for more information on video banks.)
The formally defined selections for the bits are as follows: 

|Bits 7 6|RAM block for VIC video bank|
|-|-|
|0 0|0|
|0 1|1|
|1 0|2|
|1 1|3|

Remember, however, the 128 actually has only two 64K
blocks of RAM. Thus, the setting of bit 7 is meaningless, although that bit will retain whatever value you write to it.
Only the setting of bit 6 matters, since the choice is between
blocks 0 and 1. The default setting for these bits is %00, since
the normal VIC text and bitmapped screens are located in
block 0 RAM.

You should note that the operating system and BASIC
will not support a VIC video bank in block 1. That is, all the
screen editor ROM routines and BASIC bitmapped graphics
routines assume that the VIC screen is located in block 0
RAM, and will continue to write data to block 0 even after
you've changed these bits to switch the video bank into block
1 RAM. Thus, you must provide your own text and graphics
routines for a display from block 1. For text displays, you can
use the standard character sets because the character ROM is
still visible in a block 1 video bank. 

These bits actually determine the RAM block for all DMA
(direct memory access) operations, not just for the VIC chip,
but the VIC is the only built-in device in the 128 to use DMA.
The only other commonly available DMA device for the 128 is
the REC (RAM expansion controller) chip in the 1700 and
1750 Memory Expansion Modules. These bits, rather than bits
6-7 of the configuration register, determine which block of
128 system RAM is affected by REC transfer operations.
