### I/O port data registers

The CIA chip has two eight-line data ports, designated A and
B. Each bit in the data registers is connected to one of the port
lines (PA0-PA7 for port A and PB0-PB7 for port B). The lines
can be either inputs or outputs, depending on the setting of
the data direction registers ([56322-56323/$DC02-$DC03](#DC02)). For
port B, bits 6-7 (lines PB6-PB7) can also have special timer
output functions. See the discussion of the control registers at
56334-56335/$DC0E-$DC0F for more information.

When a port line is set for input, its corresponding data
register bit will reflect the state of the line. The bit will hold
%0 when the line is pulled low (0 volts), or %1 when the line
is high (+ 5 volts). An unconnected input line, or one connected
to a device that isn't actively pulling the line low, will
"float" in a high state, and the corresponding data register bit
yn\\ hold a %1 . Writing to a data register bit for an input line
has no effect on the state of the line, or on the value returned
when the bit is read. However, the value written to the bit will
be retained internally, and will determine the state of the line
if the line is changed to an output.

When a port line is set for output, its corresponding data
register bit will control the state of the line. Setting the bit to
%0 will pull the line to a low (0 volts) state, and setting the
bit to %1 will allow the line to go to a high state (+5 volts).
Note that string the bit to %1 doesn't guarantee that the output
line will be set to a high state. The data CIA can force an
output line low when an external device connected to the line
is trying to hold the line high, but it cannot bring an output
line high when an external device is holding the line low.
Reading the data register bit for an output line returns the
current state of the line (%0 if the line is low, or %1 if the line is
high). Thus, a line set for output can still be used for a limited
form of input. If the data register bit for the output line is set
to %1, then reading that bit will return %1 while the output
line is high and %0 when an external device pulls the line
low. This explains how a joystick can be read from port A despite
the fact that the lines of that port are normally configured as outputs.

Port B has a feature not available with port A. A special
handshaking output line (from the CIA) designated PC, normally high,
will go low for one system clock cycle each time
data is read from or written to port B. This can be used to signal
an external device that data has been written or accepted
at the port. The PC line from CIA #1 is not connected to anything
in the 128, but the PC line from CIA #2 is available at
pin 8 of the user port.

For CIA #1, all port A lines are normally configured as
outputs and all port B lines are normally configured as inputs.
This is to set up the lines for their primary function—reading
the keyboard. 

The second major function of these ports is to read the
status of digital controllers connected to the two control ports
°n the side of the 128. Each control port is connected to five
lines of one of the CIA #1 ports. Port B is connected to control
port 1 (the front one) and port A to control port 2 (the back
one), which is the opposite of what you might expect. The
connections are as follows:

|CIA port bit|Controller port pin|Joystick function|
|-|-|-|
|0|1|up|
|1|2|down|
|2|3|left|
|3|4|right|
|4|6|button|

The control port pins are usually described in terms of
their joystick functions, since the joystick is the device most
commonly connected to the ports. A joystick is a very simple
device consisting of five switches, one for each of the four
primary directions and one for the fire button. The switches are
normally open, meaning that no connection is made when the
joystick is not being pressed. Remember that unconnected CIA
port lines float to a high state (+ 5 volts), so the corresponding
CIA port bits will be %1. Pressing the stick in one of the eight
possible directions (four primary directions and four diagonals)
closes one or two of the switches, grounding the CIA port
lines and forcing the corresponding bit or bits to %0. Pressing
the fire button grounds that line, so it is possible to have as
many as three lines simultaneously grounded.

For reading the joysticks, BASIC provides the JOY function [$8203],
which returns a value from 1-7, depending on
the direction the stick is pressed (the value is 0 if it is not
being pressed), with 128 added if the fire button is pressed. To
read the joystick from machine language, you simply read the
corresponding CIA port data register and check for %0 bits.
Even though the port A lines are normally set up as outputs,
you can still read the joystick without switching the lines to
inputs. The keyboard scan routine leaves all port A bits except
bit 7 set to %1 , so it is still possible for external devices like
the joystick to pull the lines low (bit 7 of that port will normally
always be %0). The possible port readings are as follows:

&lt;TBD - undecifrable table&gt;

If the fire button is pressed, bit 4 of the data register will also
be set to %0, and the values listed above will be reduced by
16/$10.
If you'd prefer to read %1 bits instead, try the following
code:

|Control port 1|Control port 2|
|-|-|
|LDA $DC01|LDA $DC00|
|AND #$1F|AND #$1F|
|EOR #$1F|EOR #$1F|

Using this method, the accumulator will hold one of the following
values after the port is read:

|Value|Joystick direction|
|-|-|
|0/$00|not pressed|
|1/$01|up|
|2/$02|down|
|4/$04|left|
|5/$05|up + left|
|6/$06|down + left|
|8/$08|right|
|9/$09|up + right|
|10/$0A|down + right|

Pressing the fire button will add 16/$10 to any of the values
listed above.

You should be aware, however, that using control port 1
(CIA port B) for joystick input can have an undesirable side effect.
Since the input lines of that port are also used for reading
the keyboard, the keyscan routine [$C55D] has no way to tell
whether the port lines are being grounded by keypresses or
joystick presses. As a result, moving a joystick effectively generates
a keypress, and certain keypresses produce the same effect as moving
the joystick:

### Joystick conflicts and Keyboard conflicts

|Direction|Effective keypress|Keypress|Effective direction|
|-|-|-|-|
|up|ALT|1|up|
|down|SHIFT-INST/DEL|-|down|
|left|RETURN|CONTROL|left|
|right|cursor left|2|right|
|fire|SHIFT-F7|space|fire|

Many programs avoid this problem by using only port A
(control port 2), which is the simplest solution. Because the
port A lines are outputs, the joystick is never mistaken for the
keyboard in control port 2. You can prevent the keyboard conflicts by
disabling interrupts and forcing all keyboard column
lines high before reading the port (add SEI:LDA #$FF:STA
$DC00:STA $D02F before the LDA $DC01 instruction, and
CLI after it). The joystick conflicts are more difficult to
prevent—there is no way to disable the joystick. If your program
doesn't require keyboard input, a rather inelegant solution is
to simply zero the count of keys in the buffer and pending
function key characters (locations [208/$D0](0000#D0) and [209/$D1](0000#D1))
before exiting from the program.

Any device which behaves like a joystick can be read in
the same manner. This includes trackballs and the new mouse
controllers (which are more or less upside-down trackballs).
Devices such as paddles or graphics tablets are analog, not
digital, devices, and are read by the SID chip. See the entry
for the SID registers at [54297-54298/$D419-$D41A](D400#D419). However,
any buttons on these devices are read as if they were
joystick lines. For example, the two buttons on a standard pair
of Commodore paddles are read exactly like the joystick left and
right-direction lines for the corresponding control ports.
Since the CIA ports are bidirectional, you could also use the
control port lines in interfacing projects. Together they provide
ten lines which can be either inputs or outputs.

The final function of these CIA ports is that bits 6-7 (lines
PA6-PA7) of port A control which control port will be connected to
the SID lines for reading paddles. Since paddles
come in pairs and the 128 has two control ports, you can connect up
to four paddles. However, the SID has only two paddle inputs. As a
result, you can read paddles from only one
port at a time. 

The port A lines are always outputs, so there is
no problem with using them for this purpose. The default
value in port A (except during the IRQ, when it is being used
to scan the keyboard) is 127/$7F. This has the bits set to %01,
selecting control port 1. Unless you really need four paddles,
it's best to use this port. To write any value other than
127/$7F into port A, you must disable interrupts, since the
keyboard-scanning routine always leaves the port set to that
value.

Another bit of 128 hardware trivia: Our experience
indicates that a CIA #1 failure is one of the most common
hardware problems the 128 owner is likely to experience. Integrated
circuit chips like the CIA are very sensitive to electric
discharges such as the static electric spark you see when you
touch a doorknob after shuffling across a carpet. Since the
control port lines lead directly to the pins of CIA #1, touching
a control port pin when your body carries a static charge is
like a lightning strike to the chip. Unfortunately, since the
control ports lie so close to the reset and power switches, it's
very easy to touch them unintentionally, especially control
port 2. Of the five 128s we have had at COMPUTE! Publications to date,
three have experienced "blown" CIAs. Bit 1 of
port A seems to be particularly susceptible. This is in keeping
with our experience with Commodore 64s over the past several years,
where we have lost approximately a dozen CIA
chips out of about 30 computers. If one joystick direction or a
group of keys suddenly becomes impossible to read, a blown
CIA is the likely source. To prevent this, some users resort to
covering the control ports with masking or electrical tape
when the port is not in use. Another solution is to leave the
joystick plugged in at all times.

### Data direction registers

Each of the eight lines in the CIA's two data ports can be
individually configured as either an input or an output. These data
direction registers (DDRs) specify the direction of data flow on
the port lines. Each register bit corresponds to one port line
(PA0-PA7 for port A and PB0-PB7 for port B). Setting a register bit
to %0 makes the corresponding port line an input
while setting the bit to %1 makes the line an output. The lines
are read and controlled by the data registers at
[56320-56321/$DC00-$DC01](#DC00). For lines PB6-PB7 of port B, the settings of
bits 6-7 of 56323/$DC03 can be superseded when those lines
are used for their special timer output functions. See the discussion
of the control registers at [56334-56335/$DC0E-$DC0F](#DC0E)
for more information.

For CIA #1, the IOINIT routine [$E109]—part of both the
reset and RUN/STOP-RESTORE sequences—initializes the
port A DDR (56322/$DC02) to 255/$FF, making all port A
lines outputs, and the port B DDR (56323/$DC03) to 0/$00,
making all port B lines inputs. These settings are not changed
by any other ROM routines. You can change these settings
briefly for special I/O functions involving the control ports,
but leaving any port A lines set as inputs or port B lines set as
outputs will disable normal keyboard functioning. See the discussion
of the data registers above for more information on
the uses of the port lines.

### Timer A latch/counter registers

Timer A is a programmable counter that can provide a variety
of timing functions. It is a countdown timer, meaning that it
repeatedly decrements the counter contents until the value is
decremented below zero, a condition known as underflow.
When Timer A underflow causes an internal CIA interrupt, bit
0 of the CIA interrupt register at [56333/$DC0D](#DC0D) will be set to
%1. The timer can be set to count down repeatedly or just
once. The timer countdown can be driven by either of two
sources: the system clock frequency or a signal provided on
the CNT line by an external device. The operating conditions
of the timer are specified in the CIA control register A
([56334/$DC0E](#DC0E)).

When read, the registers here return the current value in
the 16-bit counter (low byte in 56324/SDC04 and high byte in
56325/$DC05), Data written to these registers does not go directly
into the counter unless the timer is currently stopped.

Instead, the values are held in an internal latch register. The
latch contents are transferred into the counter whenever the
timer underflows. Alternatively, a bit in the control register
can force an immediate transfer of the latched value into the
counter.

One special function of timer A is to control the rate of
data output over the CIA's serial port (SP) line. In this case,
timer A generates a clock signal that is provided as an output
on the CNT line. Since timer A must underflow twice to produce
the full clock cycle on the CNT line required for each bit,
you should load timer A with a value which will produce an
underflow in half the time desired for each bit. In other words,
the duration of each bit transmitted on the serial line will be
twice the time required to count down the value specified in
the timer A latch. See the entry for the CIA serial data register
([56332/$DC0C](#DC0C)) for more information on the CIA's serial data
I/O capabilities.

For CIA #1, timer A can be a source of IRQ interrupts to
the processor. This feature is used during tape I/O to generate
the IRQ interrupts which drive the reading and writing of
data. CIA #1 timer A also controls the transmission rate for
data sent over the fast serial bus. Thus, if you use the timer
for your own timing applications, you should be aware that
both tape and fast serial operations will change the settings of
the timer. The timer will be stopped upon completion of any
tape or fast serial operation. The IOINIT routine [$E109] calls
the Kernal fast serial output setup routine, which starts the
timer counting down from $0004, but then immediately calls
the fast serial input setup routine, which halts timer A. Thus,
upon completion of the reset or RUN/STOP-RESTORE sequence, the timer
will contain some very low value: usually
either $0001 or $0002. Unlike the Commodore 64, CIA #1
timer A is not the source of the 128's normal jiffy IRQ interrupts.
That task is instead performed by raster interrupts from
the VIC chip.
