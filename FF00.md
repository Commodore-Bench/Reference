### Configuration register 

This is one of the most important locations in all of 128 memory, since the value here determines what other memory elements will be visible to the processor. The entire design of the
128 is contingent on the MMU's ability to make various selections of the system's memory resources visible at shared locations within the processor's limited address space. The 16
banks supported by the operating system are merely 16 predefined settings of this register-not 16 physical arrangements
of memory. 

Configurations other than the standard banks are certainly
possible. Since each of the eight bits of this register is assigned
a function in the MMU specifications, there are theoretically
256 possible different memory configurations. Actually, there
are only 128 functional combinations because bit 7 of the register in not implemented in the current version of the MMU.
However, not all of these possible configurations are equally
useful. For example, none of the configurations which involve
either internal or external function ROM are useful unless you
have a function ROM installed. The only configuration regularly employed by the system that doesn't correspond to a
standard bank is one used by BASIC, consisting of BASIC
ROM, screen editor ROM, character ROM, and Kernal ROM,
plus block 1 RAM (essentially the same as bank 14, but with
RAM from block 1 instead of block 0). Machine language programmers may find it useful to set up a configuration which
switches out BASIC ROM while retaining the I/O block and
screen editor and Kemal ROM. Such a configuration leaves 41K
free for ML programs in the range 7168-49151/$1C00-$BFFF.
To set up this arrangement, use LDA #$0F:STA $FF00

This location has an identical twin at address [54528/$D500](D500). Actually, there is only one configuration register, but it
can be accessed at two different addresses. The higher address
is used almost exclusively because it is visible in all memory
configurations, whereas the register is visible at [54528/$D500](D500)
only when the I/O block is selected (and you must have access to the configuration register to make the I/O block visible). Both registers will hold identical values, regardless of
which register is written to set the value. 

There is an alternative to storing values directly in this
register. You can store up to four configuration register
settings in the preconfiguration registers at 54529-54532/$D501-$D504, then transfer the values to the configuration
register by writing to the corresponding load configuration
registers at 65281-65284/$FF01-$FF04. See the preconfiguration and load configuration register entries for details.

**Bit 0**: this bit determines what is seen at addresses in the
range 53248-57343/$D000-$DFFF. When the bit is set to %0,
the I/O block (containing hardware chip registers and color
RAM) is visible. When the bit is set to %1, the contents of the
address area is determined by the setting of bits 4-5. 

**Bit 1**: this bit determines what is seen at addresses in the
range 16384-32767/$4000-$7FFF. When the bit is set to %0,
the lower portion of BASIC ROM appears there. When the bit
is set to %1, the address area will contain RAM from the block
specified in bits 6-7.

**Bits 2-3**: these bits determine what is seen at addresses in the
range 32768-49151/$8000-$BFFF. The four possible selections
are as follows:

|Bits 3 2|Address range contents|
|-|-|
|0 0|Upper portion of BASIC ROM ($8000-$AFFF), plus monitor ROM ($B000-$BFFF)|
|0 1|Internal function ROM|
|1 0|External function ROM|
|1 1|RAM|

Internal function ROM refers to ROM in the free ROM socket
on the 128 circuit board. External function ROM refers to
ROM in a cartridge plugged into the expansion port. If you select either of these sources when no ROM is actually installed,
the area will appear to contain unpredictable changing values.
When RAM is selected in this area, the block from which the
RAM will be seen is determined by the setting of bits 6-7. 

**Bits 4-5**: these bits determine what is seen at addresses in the
range 49152-65535/$C000-$FFFF, with some exceptions. The
MMU configuration and load configuration registers always
appear at 65280-65284/$FF00-$FF04, regardless of the
settings of these bits. Also, bit 0 of this register can override
the specification for the contents of addresses in the range
53248-57343/$D000-$DFFF. As long as bit 0 is set to %0, the
I/O block will be seen in that portion of this area, regardless
of the setting of these bits. The four possible selections for this
area are as follows: 

|Bits 5 4|Address area contents|
|-|-|
|0 0 |Screen editor ROM ($C000-$CFFF), character ROM ($D000-$DFFF), Kernal ROM ($E000-$FFFF)|
|0 1|Internal function ROM|
|1 0|External function ROM|
|1 1|RAM|

Internal function ROM refers to ROM in the free ROM socket
on the 128 circuit board. External function ROM refers to
ROM in a cartridge plugged into the expansion port. If internal
or external function ROM is selected when no ROM is actually
present, the area will appear to contain unpredictable changing values. When RAM is selected, the area will contain RAM
from the block specified in bits 6-7, unless the MMU's RAM
configuration register at 54534/$D506 specifies a common
area at the top of memory. When a common area is enabled,
all RAM in the common area will come from block 0, regardless of the block specified in bits 6-7. 

**Bits 6-7**: the memory configuration established by the 128 always includes RAM in the lowest 16K area (addresses
2-16383/$0002-$3FFF), and RAM may be selected in any of
the other three 16K segments in the processor's 64K address
space. These bits determine which 64K RAM block the RAM
in the selected configuration will be seen from. The formal
specifications for these bits are as follows: 

|Bits 7 6|RAM block selected|
|-|-|
|0 0|Block 0|
|0 1|Block 1|
|1 0|Block 2|
|1 1|Block 3|

Remember, however, that the 128 actually has only two 64K
blocks of RAM (blocks 0 and 1). Thus, the setting of bit 7 is
meaningless and has no effect in the current version of the
MMU. Bit 7 will retain whatever value you write to it, but
only bit 6 is significant.

The block specification in these bits will be overridden for
certain ranges of memory if any common RAM areas are specified by the RAM configuration register at [54534/$D506](D500#D506).
When common areas are enabled, any visible RAM in the
common range will be seen from block 0, regardless of the setting of these bits.

These bits specify the RAM block for the processor only;
the block in which the VIC (40-column) chip's video RAM
bank is seen can be selected independently. The VIC block is
specified in bits 6-7 of the MMU's RAM configuration register
at [54534/$D506](D500#D506). The RAM configuration register bits, rather
than the configuration register bits, also determine which
block will be affected by other DMA (direct memory access)
operations, such as data transfers by the REC (RAM expansion
controller) chip in the RAM expansion modules.

### Load configuration register 

Each of these registers has a corresponding preconfiguration
register at 54529-54532/$D501-$D504. Storing a value in a
load configuration register causes the value in the preconfiguration register to be transferred to the configuration register. The value stored in the load configuration register is
irrelevant; it is the store operation, rather than the value
stored, which causes the transfer. Reading any of the load
configuration register locations returns the value in the corresponding preconfiguration register. Values stored in a load
configuration register location have no effect on the value returned when the register is read.

The 128 operating system does not use the preconfiguration or load configuration registers, but BASIC does. See the
entry above for the pre configuration registers for details of the
standard configuration settings.
