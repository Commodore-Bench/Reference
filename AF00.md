# $AF00-$AFFF - BASIC Jump Table

# BASIC Jump Table
The Commodore 128's BASIC 7.0 includes a feature not found
in previous versions: a jump table. Like the Kemal and screen
editor jump tables, the BASIC table provides stable entry
points to a number of important BASIC routines. If you want
to call a BASIC routine from within one of your own machine
language programs, you should use the jump table entry if
one is provided. If you call a BASIC ROM routine directly,
your program will not work if the address of the routine is
changed in a future version. Presumably, Commodore will update the
jump table if BASIC ROM is ever revised, so that
jump table calls will remain valid.

In the discussions below, FAC1 refers to floating-point
accumulator #1, locations [$63-$67](0000#63), and FAC2 refers to
floating-point accumulator #2, locations $6A-$6E(0000#6A).

## 44800 $AF00 JAYINT <a name="AF00"></a>
<span class="badge badge-info">Entry point for the AYINT routine, currently at [$84B4](4000#84B4).</span>

This routine converts the contents of [FAC1](## "Floating-point
accumulator 1 - $63-$67") into a two-byte
signed integer value in locations 102-103/$66-$67 (high byte
in [$66](0000#66), low byte in [$67](0000#67)). The routine tests the original
value and generates an ILLEGAL QUANTITY error message if it is not in the
range -32768-32767.

## 44803 $AF03 JGIVAYF <a name="AF03"></a>
<span class="badge badge-info">Entry point for the GIVAYF routine, currently at [$793C](4000#793C).</span>

This routine converts the two-byte signed integer
value in the Y register and accumulator (low byte in Y, high
byte in the accumulator) into a floating-point value in [FAC1](## "Floating-point
accumulator 1 - $63-$67").

## 44806 $AF06 JFOUT <a name="AF06"></a>
<span class="badge badge-info">Entry point for the FOUT routine, currently at [$8E42](4000#8E42).</span>

This routine creates a string of characters representing the
floating-point value in [FAC1](## "Floating-point
accumulator 1 - $63-$67"). The string starts at location
253/$0100 and is terminated with a zero byte. The first character of the
string is a space (code 32/$20) if the value was
positive, or a minus sign (-) if the value was negative.

## 44809 $AF09 JVAL_1 <a name="AF09"></a>
<span class="badge badge-info">Entry point for the VAL_1 routine, currently at [$8052](4000#8052).</span>

This routine reads a string of characters from bank 1 and generates
the equivalent floating-point value in [FAC1](## "Floating-point
accumulator 1 - $63-$67"). Locations
[$24-$25](0000#24) point to the the starting address of the string
and the accumulator holds the length of the string. This routine will
leave the system in BASIC's alternate bank 14 configuration in which
block 1 RAM is visible, so it shouldn't be
called by a routine in bank 0.

## 44812 $AF0C JGETADR <a name="AF0C"></a>
<span class="badge badge-info">Entry point for the GETADR routine, currently at [$8815](4000#8815).</span>

two-byte unsigned integer in locations 22-23/$16-$17 (low
byte in [$16](0000#16), high byte in [$17](0000#17)). The integer value will
also be in the Y register (low byte) and accumulator (high
byte) upon return. Before performing the conversion, the routine checks
that the value [FAC1](## "Floating-point
accumulator 1 - $63-$67") is in the range 0-65535, and
generates an ILLEGAL QUANTITY error message if it is not.

locations 100-101/$64-$65 (low byte in [$65](0000#65), high byte
in [$64](0000#64)) into a floating-point value in [FAC1](## "Floating-point
accumulator 1 - $63-$67"). For this routine to function properly, you must also load the X register
with the value 144/$90 and make sure the status register
carry bit is set.
