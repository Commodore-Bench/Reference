# $1000-$10FF - Programmable Key Definition String Area

# Programmable Key Definition String Area

## 4096-4351/$1000-$10FF <a name="1000"></a>
This 256-byte area is used to hold the strings for the ten
programmable keys supported by the 128's screen editor routines:
F1-F8, SHIFT-RUN/STOP, and HELP. Each of the first 10
bytes of the area (4096-4105/$1000-$1009) holds the length
of one of the definition strings:

|Location|Key|
|-|-|
|4096/$1000|F1|
|4097/$1001|F2|
|4098/$1002|F3|
|4099/$1003|F4|
|4100/$1004|F5|
|4101/$1005|F6|
|4102/$1006|F7|
|4103/$1007|F8|
|4104/$1008|SHIFT-RUN/STOP|
|4105/$1009|HELP|

The remaining 246 bytes (4106-4351/$100A-$10FF) are
available for definition strings. There is no particular limit on
the length of an individual definition string, except that the
combined length of all the definition strings cannot exceed 246
bytes. The definition strings correspond to keys in the order
shown above. The offset to the first character in a particular
string is found by adding the lengths of all preceding definitions.
No special characters are used to separate the strings. It
is possible for a key to have no associated definition string, in
which case the length location for the key should be set to
0/$00. The default definitions for the keys are as follows:

|Key|Default definition|
|-|-|
|F1|GRAPHIC|
|F2|DLOAD"|
|F3|DIRECTORY{RETURN}|
|F4|SCNCLR{RETURN}|
|F5|DSAVE"|
|F6|RUN{RETURN}|
|F7|LIST{RETURN}|
|F8|MONITOR{RETURN}|
|SHIFT-RUN/STOP|DL"*{RETURN}RUN{RETURN}|
|HELP|HELP{RETURN}|

These definitions, along with the corresponding length values,
are copied from locations 52904-52980/$CEA8-$CEF4 in
screen editor ROM during the Kernal CINT routine [$C07B](C000#C07B). In
BASIC, the KEY statement can be used to change definitions.
From machine language, the Kernal PFKEY routine [$FF65](E000#FF65) (or
screen editor KEYSET routine [$C021](C000#C021)) can be used. Programmable keys
are handled by a subroutine [$C6CA](C000#C6CA) within
the screen editor keyscan routine.
