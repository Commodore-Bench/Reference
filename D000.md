## 53248-53264 $D000-$D010 Sprite horizontal and vertical position registers <a name="D000"></a>

The position of each sprite is controlled by a pair of these registers
plus a bit in the register at [53264/$D010](#D010). The extra bit
is required because the horizontal position value can exceed 255.
The extra bit is effectively the ninth (most significant) bit
of the horizontal position register. The relationship of registers
to sprites is as follow:

|Sprite |Horizontal register | Bit in $D010| Vertical register|
|-|-|-|-|
|0| 53248/$D000| 0|53249/$D001|
|1| 53250/$D002| 1|53251/$D003|
|2| 53252/$D004| 2|53253/$D005|
|3| 53254/$D006| 3|53255/$D007|
|4| 53256/$D008| 4|53257/$D009|
|5| 53258/$D00A| 5|53259/$D00B|
|6| 53260/$D00C| 6|53261/$D00D|
|7| 53262/$D00E| 7|53263/$D00F|

The values in these registers specify a sprite's position on
the screen. Actually, the values set the position of the upper
left corner of the 24 X 21-pixel sprite pattern. The coordinate
system used is slightly different from the one used for bitmapped
graphics, as illustrated in next figure. Note that the
sprite coordinate system remains the same regardless of the
current screen mode (character or bitmapped) or sprite mode
(standard or multicolor).

![Vic sprite position values](./resources/008-06-f-vic-sprite-position-values.png "Vic sprite position values")

The horizontal position range includes both the active
screen area and the inactive left and right borders, in units
that equal standard screen pixel widths. The vertical position
range also includes the top and bottom borders in addition to
the active screen area. Note that the horizontal position can be
greater than 255, which is the largest value that can be stored
in a horizontal position register. To move a sprite to horizontal
position 256, you must set the horizontal position register to
0/$00 and set the most significant horizontal bit for that sprite
(in the register at 53264/$D010) to %1.

The most significant
bit must remain set for all positions greater than 255. Because
of the extra programming required to move the sprite to this
right portion of the screen, the vertical column at horizontal
position 256 is frequently referred to as the seam.
The values in these registers cannot be changed directly
while the normal BASIC IRQ routine [$A84D] is in use. That
routine copies the contents of the shadow sprite position locations
(4566-4582/$11D6-$11E6) into these registers during
each system IRQ interrupt. There are two
ways to deal with this. The simplest solution is to store the
desired sprite position values in the proper shadow location.

If you wish to use the true registers, you can prevent the execution of
the BASIC portion of the IRQ interrupt. This will disable most
BASIC sprite and sound commands, but that shouldn't be a
problem for machine language programmers. To prevent execution of
the BASIC IRQ routine, you can either set bit 0 of
the initialization status flag at [2564/$0A04](#0A04) to %0 (which tells
the Kernal that BASIC is not initialized), or you can store any
nonzero value in the BASIC IRQ status flag at [4861/$12FD](#12FD).

## 53265 $D011 Vertical smooth scrolling and control register <a name="D011"></a>
**Bits 0-2**: these bits control the VlC's vertical fine scrolling
feature. The value here specifies how many scan lines downward
the display should be shifted. The available three bits
allow the screen to be scrolled up to seven scan lines. The
IOINIT routine [$E109] initializes these bits to %011 = 3, so
the default display will be scrolled down three scan lines from
its highest possible position.
The display scrolls without wrapping; blank scan lines are
moved in from the top and scan lines on the bottom move off
the visible screen. Pixels in scan lines scrolled off the bottom
of the display are not erased. They become visible again if the
display is scrolled back upward by reducing the value in these
bits. The 24-row feature is useful with scrolling because it
creates hidden scan lines at the top and bottom of the screen that
can be scrolled onto the visible area.

**Bit 3**: this bit determines the vertical height of the active
portion of the screen display. Setting this bit to %1 selects a 25-row
(200 scan-line) active screen. The bit is initialized to this
setting during the IOINIT routine [$E109], and neither the
operating system nor BASIC changes this value. Setting this bit
to %0 reduces the height of the active portion of the display
to 24 rows (192 scan lines) by blanking the top four and bottom
four scan lines of the display. The pixels in the blanked
columns aren't erased; they'll still be intact when the screen is
switched back to 25 rows. The 24-row feature is useful in
conjunction with the vertical scrolling feature described in bits 0-2.

**Bit 4**: this bit enables or disables the VIC screen display.
While the bit is %1, the VIC provides its normal screen output.
The bit is initialized to this setting during the IOINIT routine [$E109].
When the bit is set to %0, the VIC suspends the
active portion of the display and provides a solid screen in the
border color specified in the register at [53280/$D020](#D020). The
screen is not erased, just blanked. Any text or graphics will
still be intact if the screen is again enabled. With the display
blanked, the VIC doesn't have to steal timing cycles from the
processor as it normally does. As a result, the 128 actually
runs about 7 percent faster with the VIC display off.
There are several uses for this blanking feature. For example, you
could blank the display while drawing a complex
bitmapped graphics screen, then dramatically unveil the completed
picture by reenabling the display. Since the VIC cannot
provide a proper display at the 2-MHz clock rate, the VIC display
is normally blanked when the system is switched to fast
mode. One step in the BASIC statement FAST involves setting
this bit to %0. The SLOW statement returns it to %1. This bit
is also set to %0 to blank the screen during tape operations,
and restored to %1 upon completion of the operations.

**Bit 5**: this bit selects whether the VDC will generate a character
mode display or a bitmapped mode display.
Setting this bit to %0 selects character mode, while setting it
to %1 selects bitmapped mode.
This bit cannot be directly modified while the normal system interrupt
sequence is active because a step in the screen editor IRQ routine
[$C194] sets this bit according to the screen
mode flag (location [216/$D8](0000#D8)). To change the setting of this
bit, you can either store the appropriate value in the flag
location, or you can disable the screen-setup portion of the IRQ
routine and change this bit directly. To use the flag location,
set bit 5 of location [216/$D8](0000#D8) to the desired setting (%0 or %1)
for the register bit. To turn off the screen-setup portion of the
interrupt routine, store the value 255/$FF in location [216/$D8](0000#D8).

**Bit 6**: this bit controls extended background color mode,
which offers a choice of four different background colors for
each character position. For details about this mode, refer to
the introduction for this section. Extended background color
mode is enabled when this bit is set to %1. The mode works
only in conjunction with character mode. You should not select
extended background color mode while bit 5 is set to %1
to select bitmapped mode.

**Bit 7**: this bit is effectively the ninth bit of the raster register
at 53266/$D011. Refer to the discussion of that register for
details. The extra bit is necessary because a full screen contains
more than 256 scan lines.

## 53266 $D012 Raster compare register <a name="D012"></a>
This register has two different functions, depending on
whether it is being read from or written to. As explained in
the introduction for this section, the video screen display
consists of a stack of thin horizontal lines of dots called a raster.
When the register is read, the value returned is the number of
the raster scan line currently being drawn. The range of scanline
numbers depends on the video system in use. For NTSC
(North American) systems, values can be in the range 0-262,
while PAL (European) systems have a maximum count of over
300.

In either case, the active portion of the screen consists of
scan lines 50-249.
The maximum scan-line number in either system is larger
than can be held in a single eight-bit register, so bit 7 of the
register at [53265/$D011](#D011) is used to hold the ninth bit of the
value. When bit 7 of [53265/$D011](#D011) is %1, you should add
256/$100 to the value in this register to get the true scan-line
number. For scan line 262, for example, bit 7 of [53265/$D011](#D011)
will be %1 and the value in this register will be 6/$06.

Because
the value in this register changes so rapidly (over 15,000
times per second), it can't be read usefully from BASIC. By the
time you PEEKed the value into a variable, the raster scan line
would have moved far beyond the line recorded in the variable value.
When you write to this register or to bit 7 of [53265/$D011](#D011),
the value written is stored in an internal nine-bit raster
compare latch register. Whenever the current scan-line count
equals the value in this register, bit 0 of the interrupt register
at [53273/$D019](D019) will be set to %1. If bit 0 of the interrupt
mask register at [53274/$D01A](D01A) was previously set to %1, this
will also trigger an external interrupt request to the processor.
The value you store in this register represents the scan line at
which you wish the interrupt to occur.

For scan-line values
less than 256, you must also set bit 7 of [53265/$D011](#D011) to %0.
For scan-line values of 256 or greater, you must set bit 7 of
[53265/$D011](#D011) to %1 and store the line number minus 256 in
this register. To calculate the top scan line corresponding to
any row of character positions, use the following formula:

```
scan line = (row * 8) + 50
```

where the row value is in the range 0-24.

Raster interrupts can be used to program a variety of special
video effects, including split screens like those in the
GRAPHIC 2 and GRAPHIC 4 modes. The 128 also uses a raster interrupt
off the visible screen (at scan line 255) to drive
the system IRQ sequence. Because of this, you cannot write a
new value directly to this register while the the normal system
interrupt sequence is in use. The screen-setup portion of the
screen editor IRQ routine [$C194] will write the value 255/$FF
to this register on every pass, except when setting up the bitmapped
portion of a split bitmapped/text screen. In that case,
the value in location [2612/$0A34](0A34) will be copied into the register.

In either case, bit 7 of the register at [53265/$D011](#D011) will
be set to %0. To use a raster interrupt for your own purposes,
you must write a new interrupt routine.

### <a name="D013"></a><a name="D014"></a> 53267/$D013 53268/$D014 Light pen horizontal and vertical positions
Whenever the VIC's LP input line is brought to a low (0 volts)
state, the raster beam's horizontal dot position and vertical
scan line are latched into these registers. The register at
53267/$D013 will hold the horizontal position value, and the
one at 53268/$D014 will hold the vertical position value. To
signal that a new value has been latched, bits 7 and 3 of the
interrupt register at [53273/$D019](#D019) will be set to %1. These
registers are read-only; writing to them has no effect. The
registers are not cleared when read; the latched values will be
retained until the LP line is again brought low.
The range of scan-line values in the register at 53268/$D014
is the same as the range of sprite vertical positions
shown in previous one figure. For example, the top scan line of the active
screen area is 50. In that figure, you'll note that the range
of horizontal positions extends to 343, which is greater than
can be represented in a single eight-bit register. To compensate,
the range of horizontal values in the register at 53267/$D013
is the equivalent of one-half the range of horizontal
values shown in previous one figure. For example, the horizontal-position
value for the center of the screen is 184, so the corresponding
light pen position will be about 92.

The LP line is connected to pin 6 of control port 1 (control port 2
does not support a light pen). A light pen has at its
tip an electronic device known as a phototransistor, which is
connected so as to cause a low pulse whenever the video
beam moves past the pen. These registers can be tricked into
reading false values. Pin 6 of control port 1 is also used for
light pen input for the VDC chip, so a light pen signal generated
on the 80-column screen will latch meaningless values in
these registers. In lieu of a light pen, several other events can
cause a pulse on the LP line. That control port pin is also used
for the joystick fire button, so pressing the button of a joystick
plugged into port 1 will also latch values in these registers.
Because of this joystick button function, the port line is also
connected to the line from row 4 of the keyboard matrix. This has
two consequences. First, pressing any of the following keys
with no light pen connected will latch meaningless values: Fl,
Z, C, B, M, period, right SHIFT, space, the 2 and ENTER keys
on the numeric keypad, and the ^ key in the cursor group.
More significantly, while a light pen is connected, all of these
keys will be "dead," and cannot be typed.

## 53269 $D015 Sprite enable register <a name="D015"></a>
This register controls which sprites are enabled. Only enabled
sprites can be visible, and only enabled sprites can be involved
in collisions. Setting a bit in this register to %1 enables
the corresponding sprite. However, an enabled sprite won't be
visible unless it is also positioned within the visible screen
area, has a pattern definition that includes some nonzero bits,
and is set to a color different from the screen background
color. Setting a bit in this register to %0 turns off the
corresponding sprite, but does not change the setting of any other
parameters. When reenabled, the sprite will still have the
same position, color, and pattern (unless those were changed
while the sprite was turned off). The sprites are controlled as
follows:

|Bit|Bit value|Sprite controlled|
|-|-|-|
|0|1/$01  | 0|
|1|2/$02  | 1|
|2|4/$04  | 2|
|3|8/$08  | 3|
|4|16/$10 | 4|
|5|32/$20 | 5|
|6|64/$40 | 6|
|7|128/$80| 7|

This register is initialized to 0/$00 (all sprites disabled) by
the IOINIT routine [$E109], part of the reset and RUN/
STOP-RESTORE sequences. Sprites are normally disabled
during tape and serial bus operations to prevent timing problems.
In this case, the contents of the register are stored in location
[2616/$0A38](0A38) for the duration of the operation, then
restored to the register when the operation is completed. You
can prevent this and keep sprites enabled by setting bit 7 of
the custom mode flag ([2618/$0A3A](0A3A)) to %1.

## 53270 $D016 Horizontal smooth scrolling and control register <a name="D016"></a>
**Bits 0-2**: these bits control the VIC's horizontal smooth scrolling
feature. The value here specifies the number of pixels the
display is to be shifted to the right. The available three bits
allow the screen to be shifted as many as seven pixels. The
display scrolls without wrapping; blank pixels are moved in
from the left and pixels on the right move off the visible
screen. Pixels scrolled off the right are not erased, just hidden.
They will become visible again if the display is scrolled back
to the left by reducing the value in these bits. The 38-column
feature is useful with scrolling because it creates a hidden left
column that can hold pixels to be scrolled onto the visible area.

**Bit 3**: this bit determines the horizontal width of the screen.
Setting this bit to %1 selects a 40-column (320-pixel) screen.
The bit is initialized to this setting during the IOINIT routine
[$E109], and neither the operating system nor BASIC ever
change this value. Changing this bit to %0 reduces the width
of the active portion of the display to 38 columns (304 pixels)
by blanking the leftmost and rightmost columns. Actually, 7
pixels on the left and 9 on the right are blanked. The contents
of the blanked columns aren't erased; they'll still be intact
when the screen is switched back to 40 columns. The 38-column
feature is useful in conjunction with the horizontal scrolling
feature in bits 0-2. Scrolling the 38-column screen the maximum 7
pixels to the right will make the contents of the previously hidden
leftmost column visible.

**Bit 4**: this bit controls multicolor mode for both the character
and bitmapped screens. While this bit is %0, foreground pixels
will be limited to one color (although the color can be different
for every character position). Setting this bit to %1 enables
multicolor mode, which allows a choice of three different colors
for each foreground pixel. However, selecting multicolor
mode also cuts horizontal resolution for the screen in half.
Selecting multicolor mode for the screen has no effect on any
sprites that might be displayed on that screen.

Sprite multicolor
mode is controlled by the register at [53276/$D01C](#D01C).
This bit cannot be directly modified while the normal system
interrupt sequence is active because a step in the screen
editor IRQ routine [$C194] sets this bit according to the screen
mode flag (location [216/$D8](0000#D8)). To change the setting of this bit
for bitmapped mode, you can either store the appropriate
value in the flag location, or you can disable the screen-setup
portion of the IRQ routine and change this bit directly. To use
the flag location, set bit 7 of location [216/$D8](0000#D8) to the desired
setting (%0 or %1) for the register bit. To turn off the screensetup
portion of the interrupt routine, store the value 255/$FF
in location [216/$D8](0000#D8).

To select multicolor character mode, you
must use the option to disable the screen setup, since the text
mode-setup subroutine always sets this bit to %0.

**Bit 5**: this bit is referred to in Commodore literature as
the reset bit, but its intended usage is unclear. The value here has
no apparent affect on any VIC operations.

**Bits 6-7**: these bits are unused. Writing to them has no effect,
and they always return %1 when read.

## 53271 $D017 Sprite vertical expansion register <a name="D017"></a>
Each bit in this register controls the vertical expansion feature
for one of the eight sprites. The relationship of sprites to register
bits is the same as for the sprite enable register ([53269/$D015](#D015)).
Setting a bit here to %1 will double the vertical
height of the corresponding sprite. Each sprite can be expanded
independently, with regard for the background screen
on which the sprite is displayed. The resolution of the sprite is
not increased-it will still be 21 pixels tall-but the height of
the pixels will be doubled. Vertical expansion can be selected
in conjunction with horizontal expansion to double the size of
a sprite. Horizontal expansion is controlled by the register at
[53277/$D01D](#D01D). The default value in this register, established
by the IOINIT routine [$E109], is 0/$00, so no sprites are initially
expanded.

## 53272 $D018 Screen and character base address register <a name="D018"></a>
The value in this register determines the location within the
current 16K VIC video bank of the two movable components
of video memory: the screen memory/video matrix and character
memory/bitmap areas. There is no provision for moving
color memory; that area always appears at 55296-56319/$D800-$DBFF.

The contents of this register cannot be changed
directly while the normal system IRQ interrupt sequence is in
use. The screen editor IRQ routine [$C194] copies the contents
of a shadow location into this register during each interrupt.
The shadow location depends on the screen mode in use. For
text mode, or for the text portion of a split screen, the contents
of location 2604/$0A2C will be copied here. For bitmapped
modes, the value in location 2605/$0A2D will be copied into
the register. You have two choices for changing the value in
this register. You can either store the desired value in the
appropriate shadow location, or you can turn off the screen
setup portion of the screen editor IRQ routine to gain direct
access to the register. To disable the screen-setup step, store
the value 255/$FF in location [216/$D8](0000#D8).

**Bit 0**: this bit is unused. Writing to it has no effect, and it
always returns %1 when read. Thus, the value read from this
register will always be odd.

**Bits 1-3**: the value in these bits determines the location of
character memory (for character mode) or of the bitmap (for bitmapped
modes). For character mode, a complete 256-character
set requires 2048 (2K) bytes, and the character set must start
on an even 2K memory address boundary. Possible selections
are as follows:

|Bits 3-2-1|Offset for character set|
|-|-|
|0 0 0|0/$00|
|0 0 1|2048/$0800|
|0 1 0|4096/$1000|
|0 1 1|6144/$1800|
|1 0 0|8192/$2000|
|1 0 1|10240/$2800|
|1 1 0|12288/$3000|
|1 1 1|14336/$3800|

These bits do not determine the absolute address of the character set,
but rather the offset from the starting address of the
current video bank. For example, video bank 2 begins at address
32768/$8000, so a bit setting of %100 in that case
would place the character set at 32768 + 8192 = 40960/$A000.
However, the default video bank (bank 0) begins at location
0/$0000, so in that case the offset is equal to the actual address.
The 128 normally provides a pair of character sets and allows you
to switch between them by pressing the SHIFT -
Commodore key combination. If you are setting up a single
custom character set, you should disable this character
set-switching feature by setting bit 7 of location [247/$F7](0000#F7) to
%1. If you wish to retain the character set-switching feature,
you must provide two character sets, one at an "even" position
(one for which bit 1 of this register is %0), and the other
at the next higher ("odd") position.
The CINT screen editor initialization routine [$C07B] sets
bits 1-3 to %010 in location 2604/$0A2C, the shadow for this
register in text mode. This places the default character memory
at an offset of 4096/$1000 from the starting address of the
video bank (and implies that the alternate character set will be
located at an offset of 6144/$1800), This may seem strange,
since there is certainly no character pattern data stored in
RAM at addresses 4096-8191/$1000-$1FFF/ and since the
128's memory map shows that the character ROM is actually
located at addresses 53248-57343/$D000-$DFFF.

However,
the 128 has the capability to make the VIC chip see character
ROM at addresses 4096-6143/$1000-$17FF (for the uppercase/
graphics set) and addresses 6144-8191/$1800-$1FFF (for the
lowercase/uppercase set) in any video bank. Note that this is
a change from the Commodore 64, which could only see character
ROM in video banks 0 and 2.

Only the VIC will see the character ROM at those addresses.
To the processor, those locations will still be RAM.
This feature is controlled by bit 2 of the 8502's built-in
I/O port, at location [1/$01](0000#01). When bit 2 of the register at
[1/$01](0000#01) is %0, the VIC chip will see character ROM in the character
memory areas beginning at addresses 4096/$1000 and
6144/$1800. No other character memory slots are affected.

When the I/O port bit is set to %1, the VIC will instead see
the true contents of RAM at those addresses rather than images
of the character ROM. Like other screen control locations,
the I/O port bit has a shadow location. Bit 2 of location
[217/$D9](0000#D9) is copied into bit 2 of location [1/$01](0000#01) during each
pass through the text screen-setup portion of the screen editor
IRQ routine. To switch out character ROM, you must set bit 2
of the shadow location to %1 (store the value 4/$04 in location [217/$D9](0000#D9)). 
Alternatively, you can disable the screen-setup
portion of the screen editor IRQ routine by storing the value
255/$FF in location [216/$D8](0000#D8); then you change bit 2 of location [1/$01](0000#01) directly.
Finding free space for a custom character set can be a challenge.
If you are using machine language exclusively, any of
the character set slots above address 4864/$1300 can be used,
but none of the address slots are completely free in the standard
configuration with BASIC. If you disable character ROM,
there is free memory at 6144-7167/$1800-$1BFF for half a character
set (128 character patterns). If your program doesn't use
a bitmapped screen, you can allocate a bitmap area and then
use the reserved space for custom character sets. For example,
if your BASIC program includes the statements GRAPHIC
1:GRAPHIC 0, the area from 7168-16383/$1C00-$3FFF will
be protected from BASIC, and any character memory slot in
that area can be used to hold the new character set.
Since the bitmap for a high-resolution display requires
8000 bytes of memory and must begin at an even 8K memory
address boundary, there are only two possible positions for
the bitmap within the 16K video bank. When you are specifying the
location of the bitmap, only the setting of bit 3 is significant.
When that bit is %0, the bitmap will begin at an
offset of 0/$0000 from the start of the video bank. When bit 3
is %1, the bitmap begins at an offset of 8192/$2000 from the
start of the video bank. The CINT screen editor initialization
routine [$C07B] sets bits 1-3 to %100 in location 2605/$0A2D,
the shadow for this register in bitmapped mode, so the default
location of the bitmap is 8192/$2000 bytes beyond the start of
the video bank (address 8192/$2000 for the default video bank).

**Bits 4-7**: these bits determine the location of the video matrix
area, which is used as screen memory in character mode and
to hold color information in bitmapped mode. The video matrix requires
1000 bytes of memory and must start on an even
IK address boundary. Possible selections are as follows:

| Bits 7-6-5-4 | Offset for video matrix |
|-|-|
|0 0 0 0 |0/$0000|
|0 0 0 1 |1024/$0400|
|0 0 1 0 |2048/$0800|
|0 0 1 1 |3072/$0C00|
|0 1 0 0 |4096/$1000|
|0 1 0 1 |5120/$1400|
|0 1 1 0 |6144/$1800|
|0 1 1 1 |7168/$1C00|
|1 0 0 0 |8192/$2000|
|1 0 0 1 |9216/$2400|
|1 0 1 0 |10240/$2800|
|1 0 1 1 |11264/$2C00|
|1 1 0 0 |12288/$3000|
|1 1 0 1 |13312/$3400|
|1 1 1 0 |14336/$3800|
|1 1 1 1 |15360/$3C00|

These bits do not determine the absolute address of the video
matrix, but rather the offset from the starting address of the
current video bank. For example, video bank 3 begins at address
49152/$C000, so a bit setting of %0010 in that case
would place the character set at 49152 + 2048 = 51200/$C800.

However, the default video bank (bank 0) begins at location 0/$0000,
so in that case the offset is equal to the actual address.

The CINT screen editor initialization routine [$C07B] sets
bits 4-7 to %0001 in location 2604/$0A2C, the shadow for
this register in text mode. This places the default character
memory at an offset of 1024/$0400 from the starting address
of the video bank. You can't change this register directly while
the normal system interrupt sequence is active. To move the
video matrix for the text screen, you can either change the
value in location 2604/$0A2C, or you can turn off the screensetup
portion of the interrupt sequence by storing the value
255/$FF in location [216/$D8](0000#D8). After that, you can change the
register directly. Even if you change the value in this register,
all printed characters will continue to go to the former screen
memory range until you change the value in location 2619/$0A3B
to reflect the new starting page for screen memory.

Because the bitmap for a high-resolution display requires
half of the memory available in a 16K video bank, only half of
the possible addresses are really useful. When setting up a
bitmapped display, you should select a video matrix area in the
portion of the video bank not occupied by the bitmap. The
CINT screen editor initialization routine [$C07B] sets bits 4-7
to %0111 in location 2605/$0A2D, the shadow for this register in
bitmapped mode, so the default location of the video
matrix in that mode is 7168/$1C00 bytes from the start of the
video bank (address 7168/$1C00 for the default video bank).
Thus, the bitmapped mode video matrix will not disturb character
mode screen memory.

To move the video matrix for the bitmapped screen, you
can either change the value in location 2605/$0A2D, or you
can turn off the screen-setup portion of the interrupt sequence
by storing the value 255/$FF in location [216/$D8](0000#D8). After that,
you can change the register directly.
