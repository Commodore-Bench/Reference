### Mode flag for 40-column screen

This location is used during the screen IRQ routine [$C194] to
determine which display mode is selected for the 40-column
(VIC) screen. The value here has no effect on the 80-column
(VDC) screen. When this location contains 0/$00, text mode is
selected. Bits 5-7 control the graphics mode configurations:

|Bit|Bit value|Mode selected|
|-|-|-|
|5|32/$20  | bitmapped|
|6|64/$40  | split bitmapped/text|
|7|128/$80 | multicolor|

More than one of these can be selected at one time. The standard
graphics modes place the following values here:

|Mode|Value|
|-|-|
|GRAPHIC 0|0/$00|
|GRAPHIC 1|32/$20|
|GRAPHIC 2|96/$60|
|GRAPHIC 3|160/$A0|
|GRAPHIC 4|224/$E0|

While the standard screen editor interrupt routine is in
use, the value here determines how the screen mode will be
set up. As a result, you cannot directly change the bitmapped
or multicolor mode control bits of the VIC chip, since those
bits will be set according to the value here. You can turn off
the screen-setup portion of the screen editor IRQ routine by
storing the value 255/$FF here. This gives you direct control
over the VIC chip register settings, but disables BASIC'S ability
to change display modes.
